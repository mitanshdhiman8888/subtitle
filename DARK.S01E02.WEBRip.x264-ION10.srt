1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:20,535
9 HOURS SINCE MIKKEL'S DISAPPEARANCE

2
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,423
Jonas!

3
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,961
LIES

4
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,171
The victim is male, between 10 and 12.

5
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,540
Time of death... about 16 hours ago.

6
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:49,286
The burns around the eyes are strange.
Like they're melted.

7
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,535
No signs of sexual abuse,

8
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,495
no sperm, no foreign DNA.

9
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,173
One thing is strange. Take a look.

10
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,540
Apart from the burns,
the ear canals are destroyed.

11
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,745
The inner ear was damaged too.

12
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,633
Both eardrums have burst.

13
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,415
From an extremely loud sound?

14
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,955
Yes... Or pressure,

15
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,541
caused by a nosedive.

16
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,498
Or by intense rotation,
such as in a centrifuge.

17
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,503
Do you know what otoconia are?

18
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,670
Tiny grains in the ear canals

19
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,130
that help us differentiate
between up and down.

20
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,498
They can get confused.

21
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,503
When the body rotates, for example.
We lose our balance.

22
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,626
With this boy, none of the grains
are where they should be.

23
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,001
Mikkel!

24
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,173
Mikkel!

25
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,575
Mikkel!

26
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,495
Mikkel!

27
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,166
What were you doing up there?

28
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,830
Ouch! Are you crazy?

29
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,330
What were you doing?

30
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,381
I heard you guys talking at school.

31
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,038
About the caves...

32
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,075
and Erik's drugs...

33
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
so I thought...

34
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,133
I don't know what I thought.

35
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,418
I'm sorry about Mikkel.

36
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:09,333
Monday night in Winden,
another boy vanished without a trace.

37
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,330
According to the police, the 11-year-old

38
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,126
was last seen
with his siblings in Winden Forest

39
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,248
near the nuclear power plant
and the Winden Caves.

40
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:23,248
The police are asking the public for tips
that may help solve the case.

41
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:28,333
Citizens' groups are also coordinating
searches with local authorities.

42
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:33,418
For two weeks now, a 15-year-old boy
from the Winden area has been missing.

43
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,130
Police have declined to comment on whether
the two missing persons cases are related.

44
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,825
Hello.

45
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,916
It's Mom.

46
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
You're probably out.

47
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,665
About Mikkel...

48
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,503
I really don't know what to say.

49
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,126
Are Martha and Magnus okay?

50
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,705
Should we...

51
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,541
Can we help?

52
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,535
Call me when you hear this.

53
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,251
We're very worried.

54
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,383
Okay.

55
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
I...

56
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,288
I couldn't get hold of Ulrich.

57
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,921
Shouldn't we go see the kids?

58
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,670
They've organized various search parties.
I have to go.

59
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,325
Where were you last night?

60
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,330
I woke up around midnight.
You weren't there.

61
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,876
Couldn't sleep.

62
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,878
I went into the garden
to get the bushes ready for winter.

63
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,826
The car wasn't there either.

64
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,790
We were out of cord.

65
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,745
I had to go to the gas station.

66
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,915
First Mads, now Mikkel.

67
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,788
It's exactly like back then.

68
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,960
When Dad's brother disappeared,
how old was he?

69
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,291
MOTHER'S DAY 1986

70
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,706
Your father was 15.

71
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,746
Mads was three years younger.

72
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,536
And he was never found?

73
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,083
We talked about Erik.

74
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,416
In the forest.

75
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,955
Mikkel thought that was the worst.

76
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,998
When someone isn't found.

77
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,753
Mikkel's coming back.

78
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,460
Definitely.

79
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,041
Hey, this is Martha.
Leave a message after the beep.

80
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,753
Hey, Martha.

81
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,883
It's me.

82
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,248
I, um...

83
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,286
Just call me back, okay? Bye.

84
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,080
The dead boy is neither Mikkel nor Erik.

85
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,540
This kid is disfigured.
The eyes are completely burnt.

86
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,380
There was red soil all over his clothes.

87
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,665
But none where he was found.

88
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,251
And it looks as if someone
dressed the boy in clothes from the '80s.

89
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,578
The shoes, the Walkman...
From the '80s as well.

90
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,131
We found this around his neck:

91
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,788
a one-pfennig coin from 1986
on a red cord.

92
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,078
The cassette contains this.

93
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,000
We fall through the time stream
Then awaken from a dream

94
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,875
-And Mikkel and Erik?
-WÃ¶ller will coordinate the search.

95
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,458
For now we won't make
the discovery of the body public.

96
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,081
We've got two missing kids
and a dead, unidentified boy.

97
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,706
Contact the central office
for missing persons.

98
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,251
Question everyone in the proximity.
Everyone!

99
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,583
In the cave... there's a door!
I found a door.

100
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,541
Can I have a word?

101
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,456
There's a door inside the cave,
leading to the nuclear plant.

102
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,168
We need a search warrant. Maybe Mikkel
accessed the grounds through that door.

103
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,456
That's a high security area.
You can't just enter.

104
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,580
-Maybe he climbed the fence.
-The barbed wire?

105
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,126
We checked the fence.
There was no damage to it.

106
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,538
You're thinking the same thing, right?

107
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,333
That the cases are all connected.
The dead boy, Erik, Mikkel.

108
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,960
Maybe you were right.
It's just like it was back then.

109
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,211
Mads disappeared at the same spot.
Close to the nuclear power plant.

110
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,291
Something is wrong up there...
I just know it.

111
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,963
Okay.

112
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,791
I'll request the search warrant.

113
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,248
The police will be here soon.

114
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,833
We need to get rid of them tonight,
JÃ¼rgen.

115
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,130
Tonight.

116
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,285
They'll be snooping all over here.

117
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,040
Maybe someone else should do it.

118
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,918
Because of Erik...
They'll be watching.

119
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,630
Are you blackmailing me?

120
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
No, why?

121
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,788
Do you know the difference between
successful and unsuccessful people?

122
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,543
Exactly.

123
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,416
So do it tonight.

124
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,630
And you talk to no one.

125
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,128
Understood?

126
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,961
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

127
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,751
Can I help you?

128
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,333
I need a room.

129
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,331
Must be horrible for you.
First, the thing with your son Mads...

130
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,918
and now your grandson.

131
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,375
But...

132
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,378
the whole town is mobilizing.

133
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,878
We'll find him.

134
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,751
Maybe.

135
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,833
Maybe not.

136
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,383
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

137
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,673
Ulrich, it's me Charlotte.

138
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,631
Aleksander blocked
the search warrant immediately.

139
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,748
But we're talking to the judge now.
Please call me back once you hear this.

140
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,165

WINDEN CAVES

142
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:18,918
And so, at least hypothetically,
because of these gravitational anomalies,

143
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,750
it is possible to bend time and space.

144
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:31,631
Will we ever be able to travel through
a black hole to see what lies beyond?

145
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,920
And what price would we pay?

146
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,250
How far would scientists go?

147
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,710
Aleksander, please open the gate.

148
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,833
Let me in.

149
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
There's a door in the caves.
Maybe he got through it.

150
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,456
Let me search the slope.
Let me search your section of the caves!

151
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,165
Please.

152
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,040
I can't just let anyone in there.

153
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,288
It's a high security area.

154
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,875
My employees patrol it every day.

155
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,461
If Mikkel were here, we'd know it.

156
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,878
You fucking asshole!

157
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,328
Why are you doing this?
Are you trying to ruin me?

158
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,166
We're talking about my son!

159
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,630
I'm coming back with a search warrant!

160
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,078
And then you'll open this goddamn gate!

161
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,211
You asshole!

162
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,833
Open up!

163
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,171
I'm sorry, Ulrich.

164
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,540
-Honestly.
-Open up, man!

-I wanted to see you.
-Come on.

169
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,541
What is this?

170
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,963
Why are you here?

171
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,833
I'm so sorry.

172
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,133
Have you found out anything?

173
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,921
Stop it, please.

174
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,245
Please.

175
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,920
I can't do this, not now.

176
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,206
I'll call you, okay?

177
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,133
WHERE IS THE CROSSING?

178
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,826

179
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,786

182
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,248
Jankowski! Did you question Obendorf?

183
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,923
Yes. Why?

184
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,040
The files say he was on duty at the plant
when Erik disappeared.

185
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,380
He works in the storerooms
and as a driver sometimes.

186
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,628
-Did you confirm that?
-Of course.

187
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,750
So he has access
to the power plant grounds?

188
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,248
-I think so.
-Was he at the plant last night too?

189
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,998
No idea.

190
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,923
I haven't spoken to him yet.

191
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,416
Drop it.

192
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,133
Drop it, I said!

193
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,173
Ulrich!

194
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,665
What is this?

195
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,633
Is this yours?

196
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,750
We did it together.

197
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,673
Erik and I.

198
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,128
We sold some at the school.

199
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,713
Were you at the plant yesterday?

200
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,916
Yesterday? No, why?

201
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:54,671
What's this?

202
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,460
When people bring their junk here,
you always find something.

203
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,455
Erik was saving up for a scooter.

204
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,003
Where's my boy?

205
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,916
I don't know, JÃ¼rgen.

206
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,575
Do you think they'll find him?

207
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,671
I hope so.

208
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,078
Do you think he had a secret?

209
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,496
Mikkel?

210
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,543
No, Dad.

211
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,960
Do you think
he was keeping something from us?

212
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,825
Why do you say that?

213
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,376
Do you miss him?

214
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,081
I think I miss a notion of him.

215
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,383
I don't know who he really was.

216
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,536
Maybe we never know that.

217
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,673
What a person is really like.

218
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,291
Did you love him?

219
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,633
Whatever happens,
you'll tell me the truth.

220
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,961
Don't lie to me.

221
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,328
Whatever it is.

222
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,326
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

223
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:42,125
WHEN IS MIKKEL?

224
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,331
Who are you?

225
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,211
Why? Who are you?

226
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,131
Mikkel.

227
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,293
I live here.

228
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,628
Ulrich. And I live here.

229
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,043
You going to grow roots?

230
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,626
-You're at the wrong house, fool.
-Hey, Ulrich!

231
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,326
Come on, we need to go.

232
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,955
Yes, Katharina, I'm coming.

233
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,580
Are you dense? You don't live here.

234
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,455
Who is that?

235
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,920
The Grim Reaper. Can't you tell?

236
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,000
Ouch! Katharina.
