1
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,040
I AM NOT AFRAID

2
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,786
22 UNANSWERED CALLS - HANNAH

3
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,130
CAN WE TALK?

4
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,708
CALL ENDED

5
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,583
TRUTHS

6
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,416
Winden. Another missing person's case
shocks the town.

7
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,210
A nine-year-old boy
was reported missing this morning.

8
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,131
MISSING

9
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,918
Police officials have yet
to comment on the situation.

10
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,130
But it can be assumed,
that this case, too,

11
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,498
is connected to the disappearance
of two other children in Winden.

12
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,628
The last case of a missing child
happened only three days ago.

13
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,793
You know what happened to Erik and Mikkel?

14
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,495
That they disappeared?

15
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,378
The same thing happened to Yasin.

16
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,878
My Yasin?

17
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,130
Today he left home to go to school alone,
and he disappeared on the way there.

18
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,456
If you know anything at all,

19
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,921
then you have to tell me now.

20
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,041
This Noah...

21
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,535
What did he look like?
Can you describe him?

22
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,536
Can you describe him?

23
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,996
He was tall. As tall as Dad.

24
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,631
He had a hat on.

25
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,581
And blue eyes.

26
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,501
Did Noah steal Yasin?

27
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,833
I don't know.

28
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,036
I'll send somebody by.

29
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,375
And you will explain to him
exactly what this Noah looked like.

30
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,288
Okay?

31
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,708
Every little detail is important.

32
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,583
What was that? You don't talk
to your eight-year-old daughter that way!

33
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,415
Where were you the night Mikkel vanished?

34
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,750
At the office.

35
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,958
-I told you that.
-For how long?

36
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,461
Until you called me. 11:00 p.m.

37
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,668
I know you weren't in the office.

38
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,963
If you have anything to do
with Mikkel's disappearance,

39
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,250
or with Erik's or Yasin's,
then tell me now.

40
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,830
I don't even want to know where you were,

41
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,996
or what you were doing, or with whom.

42
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,956
But I want you
to look into my eyes right now

43
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,711
and assure me that you have nothing to do
with all of this.

44
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,503
You're nuts.

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,750
This is for you.

46
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,423
Don't you finally want to talk to me?

47
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250
Is there maybe someone I should tell
that you're okay?

48
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,786
Your parents, they...

49
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,826
They must be worried.

50
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,576
You don't have to say what happened to you
if you don't want to, but...

51
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,378
If you want,

52
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,786
no matter what it is, you can tell me.

53
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,825
It's safe with me.

54
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,750
I promise.

55
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,333
WHERE (WHEN) IS MIKKEL

56
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,128
Hey, this is Martha.
Leave a message after the signal.

57
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,331
INVALID CODE - ONE ATTEMPT REMAINING

58
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,131
UNKNOWN CALLER

59
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Hello?

60
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,923
Hello, Bartosz.

61
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,575
My name is Noah.

62
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,290
How do you know my name?

63
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,245
-Hello, Martha.
-Hello.

64
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,376
I wanted Katharina to have...

65
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541
Hannah.

66
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,500
I... I figured you weren't in the mood
to cook right now.

67
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,753
With all of this.

68
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,003
And...

69
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,333
I thought...

70
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,745
Thanks.

71
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,381
Do you want to come in?

72
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,500
How are Martha and Magnus?

73
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,876
And Ulrich?

74
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,423
I don't know.

75
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Where is he?

76
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,995
In the shower.

77
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,786
Hannah.

78
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,705
What are you doing here?

79
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,633
I...

80
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,081
Hannah brought us some food.

81
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291
I have to go to the station.

82
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,496
Could you give me a ride?

83
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,211
I came by bike.

84
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,671
It's raining so hard.

85
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,130
-Only if...
-Of course Ulrich can give you a ride.

86
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,876
Shall we?

87
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,128
Hannah?

88
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,501
Thanks for the food.

89
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,673
Sure.

90
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,126
And, really,
if you need anything, call me.

91
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,793
Yes. No, I understand that.

92
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,785
Still, on such short notice we have
to charge the full cancellation fee.

93
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,745
Yes, well I'm sorry. Goodbye.

94
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,455
Could you deliver this for me?

95
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,878
-Here, locally.
-Are you leaving us already?

96
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,208
I have to go away for a few days.

97
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,083
But I'd like to keep the room if I can.

98
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,916
-Certainly, that's no problem.
-It needs to be delivered by this evening.

99
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,920
-It's important.
-Yes, of course.

100
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Where were you this morning?
I tried to reach you all morning.

101
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,128
Therapy.

102
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,830
Have you heard from Martha?

103
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
She's not calling me back and...

104
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,665
I don't know what she needs,
the whole thing is so fucked up.

105
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541
She'll get in touch when she's ready.

106
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,498
Yeah, you're probably right.
Come on, let's play.

107
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,576
-I follow you?
-Yeah, watch the corridors ahead.

108
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,131
Can I trust you?

109
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,963
If I tell you a secret.

110
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,786
Can I trust you not to tell anyone else?

111
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,578
Yeah, sure.

112
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm in contact with Erik's dealer.

113
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,328
And I'm meeting him tonight.

114
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:38,036
-You're doing what?
-Watch it! Shoot! Triangle! No!

115
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,035
No!

116
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,535
I'm going there tonight in any case.

117
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,581
And I want you to come along.

118
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,383
Can I count on you?

119
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,001
Yeah, sure. Always.

120
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,416
FOR CHARLOTTE

121
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,833
I'm Noah.

122
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,541
I'm a priest at St. Christopher's Church.

123
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,495
Ines called me.

124
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,963
Do you believe in God?

125
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,748
How do you believe the world came to be?

126
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,833
Who created all the beautiful things?

127
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,423
The world came to be through the Big Bang.

128
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,035
13.8 billion years ago.

129
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,463
That's how space, time and matter
came to be,

130
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,291
and Earth as well.

131
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,995
The rest is evolution.

132
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,285
And what was there before the Big Bang?

133
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,458
Nothing can arise from nothing.

134
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,126
Maybe the Big Bang is nothing more
than God's act of creation.

135
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,791
My father says religion
is the brainwashing of the masses.

136
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,625
I'm sure your father knows a lot,

137
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,996
but he doesn't know everything.

138
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,830
It's good that he raised you
to question things.

139
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,956
But every now and then, it's good
to question those who question things.

140
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,995
God has a plan for every human being.

141
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,786
Including you.

142
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,626
I want you to stop calling me.

143
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,960
Okay? Just stop.

144
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,133
-I can't do this anymore.
-Is that what I am to you?

145
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,826
Some damn affair?

146
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,671
It's not something
you can just switch off.

147
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,208
I can't.

148
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,076
And neither can you.

149
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,540
Look at me.

150
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,631
Look at me!

151
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,383
And now tell me there's nothing there.

152
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,328
That this doesn't mean shit to you.

153
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,581
No matter what you need,
I'm here for you.

154
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,420
What I need?

155
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,540
Don't call me. Don't come by.
Just leave us alone.

156
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,535
Okay?

157
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,540
Get lost!

158
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,206
Don't think
that I'm just going to let you go.

159
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,043
And then she says,
"When you grow up your heart dies."

160
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,035
That line hits you, bam!
Right in your face, you know?

161
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,706
And in the end
you think they've become friends

162
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,961
because that created a bond between them.

163
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,998
But in the end, they're all stuck
in their little pigeonholes.

164
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,463
Maybe you want to see it again with me?

165
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,211
Hey!

166
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,671
Are you even listening to me?

167
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Yeah.

168
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,786
Let's talk later, okay?

169
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,713
Hey, girls, what are you up to?

170
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,125
-Want to go out for a smoke?
-Good idea.

171
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,248
Are you sure?

172
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,381
We don't have to if you don't want to.

173
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,878
I'd rather do it with you
than some other guy.

174
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,498
But you'll get condoms.

175
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,786
I don't want AIDS and I don't want kids.

176
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,041
No way, okay?

177
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,538
-Yeah.
-I'm not joking.

178
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,580
No kids.

179
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,748
Never.

180
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,245
I promise. No kids.

181
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,998
Child Protective Services
will assume custody for now.

182
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:33,003
So until we find his family
and can assess the situation better,

183
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,753
he'll be put in a children's home.

184
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,535
A children's home?

185
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,326
Can't he stay here in the hospital
for a while?

186
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,746
No. Unfortunately that's not possible.

187
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,538
But I can assure you that
the people in the children's home

188
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,375
will be able to attend
very specifically to his needs.

189
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,958
It's best for him.

190
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,916
Do you have children?

191
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,708
No.

192
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,211
I had a son
who died just after he was born.

193
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,291
Oh, I'm sorry.

194
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,133
I'm certain his family
will be in touch sooner or later.

195
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Or his school.

196
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,003
We'll find out where he belongs.

197
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,206
Well, then.

198
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,583
He's a peculiar boy.

199
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,035
Really very sensitive.

200
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,285
Don't worry.

201
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,496
I'll come get him on Wednesday.

202
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,248
POLICE

203
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,633
Do you know why I became a policeman?

204
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,495
When my brother vanished back then,
they made every mistake in the book.

205
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,535
The chief investigator
was a drunken moron.

206
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,958
And I...

207
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,285
I swore I'd do everything differently.

208
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,580
That I'd do things right.

209
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,540
That I wouldn't become
an incompetent asshole pig like him.

210
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,206
That was 33 years ago.

211
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,878
And now look at me.

212
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,996
I'm a joke.

213
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,456
I cheat on my wife.

214
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,133
My son has vanished.
I can't do anything.

215
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,171
Thirty-three years.

216
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,328
Everything is the same.

217
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,251
Just that now I'm the incompetent asshole.

218
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,043
Have you ever heard of the 33-year cycle?

219
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,208
Our calendars are wrong,
a year isn't 365 days long.

220
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,711
We're always a bit "out of sync,"
so to speak.

221
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,826
But every 33 years
everything is just like it was.

222
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,130
The stars, the planets, the whole universe
returns to the exact same position.

223
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,416
The lunar-solar cycle.

224
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,576
My grandpa was obsessed with such things,
the Big Bang and the Big Crunch.

225
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,746
Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.

226
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,673
When I was little I always felt
that something was wrong with Winden.

227
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,205
I have that same feeling again.

228
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,576
That everything's repeating.

229
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,576
That this has all happened before.

230
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,920
Like a massive déjà vu.

231
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,920
WINDEN BOY MISSING

232
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,830
You look like him.

233
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,246
Your father.

234
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,583
Do we know each other?

235
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,538
No.

236
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,248
But I knew your father.

237
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,956
It was a long time ago,
but I remember him well.

238
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,423
He saved my life back then.

239
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,998
But I only understood that much later.

240
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,000
Life is a labyrinth.

241
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,996
Some people wander around
their whole lives looking for a way out,

242
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,250
but there's only one path
and it leads you ever deeper.

243
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,126
You don't understand it
until you've reached the center.

244
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,583
Death is incomprehensible,
but you can make peace with it.

245
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,330
Till then you should ask yourself each day
if you've made the right decisions.

246
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,875
DRY CLEANING

247
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,626
This will take a while.

248
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,633
Half an hour or so.

249
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,875
Hey? Everything okay?

250
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,456
Okay.

251
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,381
I AM NOT AFRAID

252
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,003
Do you think I'm pretty?

253
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,043
Well, great.

254
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,711
Know what I sometimes imagine?

255
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,245
That I can do magic.

256
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,955
I imagine that I want something.
Really badly.

257
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,001
And then it happens, because I imagine it.

258
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,423
Like moving that bottle cap.

259
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,081
Do you know Houdini?

260
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,538
Who?

261
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,575
Harry Houdini,
one of the world's greatest magicians.

262
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,963
There is no such thing as magic,
just illusion.

263
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,461
Things only change when we change them.

264
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,955
But you have to do it skillfully,

265
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,541
in secret.

266
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,205
Then it seems like magic.

267
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,380
-Where did you learn that?
-I'm from the future.

268
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,130
-You're cool.
-No, I'm Mikkel.

269
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,955
Hi, Mikkel, boy from the future.
I'm Hannah.

270
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,291
My mother told me about the old world.

271
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,205
Before the flood.

272
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,286
She said it had been of a different kind.
Foul.

273
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,043
She would braid my hair
and recount harrowing tales,

274
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,875
of my father
and of demons from the underworlds.

275
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,171
She said all is forgiven
but nothing forgotten.

276
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,325
Then the darkness in her eyes
was greater than usual.

277
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,666
And her words flowed like waves.

278
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,745
She said all was well now the way it was.

279
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,705
MISSING

280
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:17,581
That all occupied its own space,
in the past as in the here and now.

281
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:21,826
When she spoke in this manner,
something would overcome her.

282
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,626
She would pull my braids tightly

283
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:27,208
as if to punish me for something
that dwelled in a place deep within her.

284
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,378
Something that tugged at her
from the center,

285
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,378
like a hunger that could not be satisfied.

286
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:36,673
She spoke of yesterday
as though it were before her very eyes.

287
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,210
As if today was but a veil

288
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,751
that shrouded in shadow
all that was real to her.

289
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,575
The old world came to haunt her
like a ghost

290
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:52,626
that whispered to her in a dream how
to erect the new world, stone by stone.

291
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,455
From then on,
I knew that nothing changes.

292
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,626
That all things remain as before.

293
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,881
The spinning wheel turns,

294
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,460
round and round in a circle.

295
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,378
One fate tied to the next.

296
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:14,375
A thread, red like blood,
that cleaves together all our deeds.

297
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,331
One cannot unravel the knots.

298
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,705
But they can be severed.

299
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,501
He severed ours,

300
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,881
with the sharpest blade.

301
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,130
Yet something remains behind
that cannot be severed.

302
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,253
An invisible bond.

303
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,503
CALL ENDED

304
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,170
Fuck.

305
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,421
On many a night, he tugs at it.

306
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,461
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

307
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,918
That all remains.

308
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:54,833
That was great.

309
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,205
You were great.

310
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,746
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to tell you something.

311
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,213
I wasn't in France.

312
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,165
I was in the nuthouse.

313
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,708
They call it post-traumatic stress.

314
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,746
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I didn't want you to think I was a freak.

315
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,883
What happened between us last summer,
that wasn't just nothing, was it?

316
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,831
I mean, if my father hadn't...

317
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,251
-If this all hadn't happened...
-It's okay.

318
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,875
Why did you call me this morning
and not Bartosz?

319
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,043
I'm Bartosz.

320
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,080
I know.

321
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,458
I'm Noah.

322
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,333
Don't you want to get in?

323
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,293
Are you cheating on me?

324
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,540
Where did you get that idea?

325
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,785
I'm only going to ask you this once.

326
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,376
Are you cheating on me?

327
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,166
I'd never do that.

328
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:53,705
Dad?

329
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,668
If you've seen something
you shouldn't have...

330
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,080
What do you mean?

331
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,293
Well, something that's not right.

332
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,751
Not right in what sense?

333
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,745
Well,

334
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:18,001
if someone does something with someone
and it's wrong.

335
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,461
What did you see?

336
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,035
Ulrich touched her breasts
and laid on top of her.

337
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,878
And she didn't want it.

338
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:39,076
You're going to tell me
exactly what you saw, okay?

339
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,628
And then he laid down on top of her

340
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,575
and held her mouth shut.

341
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,328
Like this.

342
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,788
Did she resist?

343
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,995
She yelled "stop" and struggled.

344
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,458
But he was on top of her.

345
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,001
Did he see you?

346
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,080
What did he do then?

347
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:19,628
-Did he...?
-He choked her and she went all red.

348
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:27,213
-Then he pulled down his pants and...
-You don't have to continue.

349
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,625
You did the right thing.

350
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,705
You were very brave.

351
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,831
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

352
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,128
"Dear Jonas,

353
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,040
by the time you read this everything
will have happened, irrevocably.

354
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,745
It can no longer be changed.

355
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,875
I would have liked
to explain things to you sooner,

356
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,076
but I hope once you understand
how everything is connected,

357
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,133
you will understand my decision.

358
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,878
I AM NOT AFRAID

359
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,711
The truth is a strange thing.

360
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,041
You can try to suppress it,

361
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,825
but it will always find its way
back to the surface.

362
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,583
We make a lie into our truth
in order to survive.

363
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,745
We try to forget.

364
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,208
Until we can't anymore.

365
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,035
We don't know
even half of the mysteries of this world.

366
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,665
We are wanderers in the darkness.

367
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,498
This is my truth.

368
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,035
On November 4, 2019

369
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:50,625
I traveled through time to the year 1986.

370
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,130
The boy from the future stayed,

371
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,248
and in time he became a man.

372
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,208
Mikkel became Michael,

373
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,331
who never knew where he belonged.

374
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,078
By the time you read this
I'll already be gone.

375
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:09,745
Mikkel?

376
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,166
Both as a boy and as a man.

377
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,168
I hope you can forgive me.

378
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,995
Everything is connected.

379
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,130
Mikkel,

380
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,708
Michael."

381
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:41,541
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO MIKKEL

382
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,456
Can I help you?

383
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,496
I'd like to talk to you about time.

384
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,750
