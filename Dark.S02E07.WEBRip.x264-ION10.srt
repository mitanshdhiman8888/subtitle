00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,508
Where is what?

183
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:21,707
[whispering] The two inches missing.

184
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,798
This is ridiculous.

185
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,257
You're under arrest.

186
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:34,335
I'm charging you
with identity theft and obstruction.

187
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,632
You can't do that.

188
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,803

-[Martha] Hannah?

190
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:57,513
Hannah!

191
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,262
-Anyone home?
-[knocking]

192
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,338
Hello!

193
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,380
[knocking]

194
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,920
[knocking]

195
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,255
Hello!

196
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,800
Hannah, if you're at home,
please open the door.

197
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:27,592
[door opens]

198
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,093
[Martha] I'm sorry, I...

199
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,588
Who are you?

200
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,300
Come in.

201
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:41,835
[door closes]

202
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,048
I, um...

203
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:01,335
I... I wanted Hannah's opinion.

204
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,762
She isn't here.

205
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:08,263
You want a drink?

206
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,457
Are you scared of me?

207
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,343
I didn't want to scare you.

208
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,007
I think I'm having déjà vu or something.

209
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,298
-I should go.
-A glitch in the matrix.

210
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,878
What?

211
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,922
Or a message from the beyond.

212
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,005
You read this all somewhere.

213
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,798
How do you know that?

214
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,915
Did you find the pendant?

215
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:13,633
[quietly] Jonas?

216
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,260
[machine beeping]

217
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:32,915
[old Egon] Do you think
I was a good police officer?

218
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:37,418
[Claudia] Oh, Dad. How would I know?

219
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:41,627
I'm sure you were good
at whatever you were doing.

220
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,053
I don't think so myself.

221
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:05,455
You... were always different.

222
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:11,628
You saw the world differently
right from the start.

223
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:15,587
[Egon sighs]

224
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,047
Sometimes I think...

225
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,342
that's what my problem is.

226
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:31,455
I can't see the world
for what it actually is.

227
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,378
I think I did something very, very stupid.

228
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,418
What do you mean?

229
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,087
You know that film,

230
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,170
where the kid and the old man

231
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,165
traveled back in time with his car?

232
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,420
I know it sounds crazy,

233
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,590
but...

234
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,297
the stuff in the film,

235
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,843
it really exists.

236
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,127
Time travel.

237
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,955
And somehow...

238
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,755
It has to do with

239
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:23,008
Mads and Helge, too.

240
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,213
Everything.

241
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,957
All the things that happened
so many years ago.

242
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,415
[ominous music]

243
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:43,382
[officer] Mr. Tiedemann.

244
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:45,882
Mr. Tiedemann.

245
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:48,303
There's a woman waiting in your office.

246
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
-Did she say why she's here?
-It's about the man in the asylum.

247
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,668
The lunatic who murdered those kids.
She says she knows him.

248
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,338
Thank you.

249
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,085
Good day.

250
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,087
Good day.

251
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,665
What can I do for you?

252
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,920
I'm...

253
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,012
looking for my husband.

254
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,627
It was in the papers.

255
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,255
The dead children.

256
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,125
There was a photo.

257
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,462
I think that's my husband.

258
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,463
Is this him?

259
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:35,513
It looks like him.

260
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,838
We searched for relatives.
No one came forward.

261
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,378
He was arrested last winter
in connection with multiple murders.

262
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,208
Can I see him?

263
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:54,133
It's not that straightforward.

264
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:59,045
Right at this moment
he's in a psychiatric institution.

265
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,085
He won't talk.

266
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,300
I understand.

267
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,212
But he could talk to me.

268
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,760
Could I ask what your name is?

269
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,462
Nielsen.

270
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,295
Katharina Nielsen.

271
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,632
Where were you all this time?

272
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,207
I promised
I would try to make it all right.

273
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,960
I am so sorry.

274
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,170
It makes sense all of a sudden.

275
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,422
It's obvious now that I understand.

276
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:51,168
-[beating on the door]
-[Katharina] Hannah!

277
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,455
Hannah, are you here?

278
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,005
Hannah?

279
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,548
-[knocking]
-Hannah!

280
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,300
Wait, don't. Please.

286
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,547
Do you know who that is? Huh?

287
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,125
Did he tell you where your brother is?

288
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,053
Who your brother is?

289
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,630
This guy

290
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,633
is the son of your brother.

291
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:34,803
My grandson, your nephew!

292
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,050
Mikkel is Michael Kahnwald,
do you understand?

293
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:43,553
And you are his aunt!

294
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,005
[Jonas] Martha...

295
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,008
I am so sorry.

296
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,172
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,880
I...

298
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,713
Believe me, I wanted...

299
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,837
[Katharina] Where's your machine?

300
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:07,462
The machine
that makes it possible to go there.

301
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:10,763
Hannah has it.

302
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,915
She disappeared.

303
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,960
Hannah?

304
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:25,302
Tell me now how I can get Mikkel back!

305
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:28,667
Mom.

306
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,545
Magnus has a time machine.

307
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,840
[Katharina] What?

308
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:34,132
We used it. It works.

309
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,010
You were there?

310
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,168
Did you see him?

311
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,420
Mikkel?

312
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,420
Keep your dirty hands off her.

313
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,797
Do you hear me?

314
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:57,593
Come on.

315
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,665
[dark, gloomy music]

316
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,592
What is this?

317
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,047
My brother.

318
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,010
He also disappeared.

319
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,168
In '86.

320
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,422
Quite similar to the case
with Mads Nielsen.

321
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,548
No trace.

322
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,297
Nothing.

323
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,958
His name was also Aleksander.

324
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:43,007
Aleksander Köhler.

325
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,673
Just like you.

326
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:48,457
Mm...

327
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,053
A regular name.

328
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,877
To be precise, there are
over 700 Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

329
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:04,423
So it wasn't easy to track down
each and every Aleksander Köhler.

330
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,457
Especially...

331
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,713
someone who chose to take
the last name of their wife.

332
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,338
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

333
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:19,762
After my parents separated,
I took my mother's last name.

334
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,668
From Köhler

335
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,205
to Clausen.

336
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:27,707
For some people
I'm still untraceable to this very day.

337
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,763
But...

338
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,048
a couple of months ago...

339
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,013
this happened.

340
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,593
Read it.

00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,303

I have no idea

what's going on in this town.

00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:20,422
...are definitely not my brother.

359
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,170
[Egon] Your husband never confessed.

360
00:31:42,255 --> 00:31:45,415
He kept insisting
that he wanted to save the children.

361
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,713
You and your husband...

362
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,462
You have children, yes?

363
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,463
No.

00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,705
No.

365
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,257
That's strange.

366
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,458
He kept saying he was looking for his son.

367
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,303
This may sound a bit odd, but...

368
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:17,208
have you ever heard mention
of a "White Devil"?

369
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,340
No.

370
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,462
What is that?

371
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,758
When he talks to you...

372
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,337
I mean, if he talks to you,

373
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,665
get him to talk to the police.

374
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,632
See if you can convince him
to make a confession.

375
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,882
[Claudia] And that man
came from the future?

376
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:50,463
To 1953?

377
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:52,627
That's when you arrested him.

378
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:56,173
And yesterday that man
tried to run away with that little child?

379
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,510
No.

380
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,803
Not that man.

381
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,592
Not quite.

382
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:06,758
The same man, but...

383
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,458
much older.

384
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,507
And you say the boy is his son?

385
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,008
I know.

386
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:17,705
It all sounds ridiculous.

387
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:21,087
The man, the old one...

388
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,883
where is he now?

389
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,760
They sent him back.

390
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,917
That does it. You're living with us.

391
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:39,958
We're getting your things.

392
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,918
So you believe me.

393
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,915
[ominous music]

394
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,093
[Peter] You traveled... with this?

395
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:58,672
To what year?

396
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:02,923
[loudly] What year?

397
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,707
[Franziska] That's what's going on.

398
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:15,512
You knew about this time travel shit.

399
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:18,127
Why didn't you say anything?

400
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,883
[cell phone ringing]

401
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,375
Martha.

402
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,763
Hey.

403
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:26,758
At Franziska's.

404
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:29,008
Yes, I'll be home right away.

405
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,590
You what?

406
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:33,587
Who?

407
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,877
Jonas is back.

408
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,053
Just like Bartosz predicted.

409
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,920
But he's older.

410
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,672
[mysterious music]

411
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,838
It's better if you stay out of this.

412
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,088
This is ridiculous.

413
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,670
You both knew that too?

414
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:11,842
This is what ruins everything!

415
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:14,052
All of your secret fucking bullshit!

416
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,050
You didn't even try to talk to us
when Papa and Benni slept together!

417
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,460
You incompetent asshole!

418
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:22,803
Franziska...

419
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,005
[door slams]

420
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,512
[guard] Open K-53!

421
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:57,588
I'd like a moment with him alone, please.

422
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,335
Uh... I'm not sure
if that's such a good idea.

423
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:05,262
Please. For just five minutes.

424
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,758
As you wish.

425
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,963
[door unlocks]

426
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,377
[guard] Come.

427
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:50,922
Ulrich?

428
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,207
Ulrich.

429
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,508
Ulrich, it's me.

430
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:09,838
Hannah.

431
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,418
Hannah?

432
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,843
Ulrich, it's me.

433
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,957
Is it really you?

434
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,257
Yes.

435
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,757
Or are you an angel?

436
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,667
Are you an angel?

437
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,838
-Is it you?
-Yes.

438
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:41,922
[Ulrich sighs emotionally]

439
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:43,705
[Hannah laughs emotionally]

440
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,918
[softly] It is you.

441
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,670
[crying]

442
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,335
Do you know where Mikkel is?

443
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:02,262
Katharina. How is Katharina?

444
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,457
Martha, Magnus?

445
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:16,212
It feels so different now,
seeing you again.

446
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,378
What?

447
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,585
If you could choose today

448
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,923
between Katharina and me...

449
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,380
What are you...

450
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,593
What are you asking?

451
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:42,795
In all the time
you and I were together, you...

452
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,172
I...

453
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,960
I can't really remember
if you ever once said to me, "I love you."

454
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:53,457
I loved you.

455
00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:59,208
I still do, love you.

456
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,590
Get me out of here
and I'll leave Katharina.

457
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:09,378
I love you.

458
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,883
Okay?

459
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:13,795
I love you.

460
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:18,213
He said I wouldn't need anyone.

461
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,375
But the truth is...

462
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:23,917
you don't need me now.

463
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,375
I do. I need you, Hannah.

464
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,763
I love you.

465
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:30,628
Get me out of here.

466
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,170
I'll do anything you want.

467
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,505
Get me out of here, please!

468
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,298
Hannah, I love you.

469
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,508
You hear me?

470
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,510
I love you.

471
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:46,053
Hannah. Please!

472
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,090
[shouting] I love you!

473
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,172
You lying fucker!

474
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,625
Please! Stay with me!

475
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:56,048
Stay with me!

476
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,297
I love you!

477
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,920
She's a liar!

478
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,295
She's a liar. Liar!

479
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,128
There is a resemblance, but...

480
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:08,133
[Ulrich] Hannah! I love you!

481
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,013
That's not my husband.

482
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,210
[Ulrich] Hannah!

483
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:15,512
I love you!

[gate closes]

485
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,052
[Ulrich] Get me out of here!

486
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,420
Mom.

487
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,710
[sniffles]

488
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,960
It'll work out.

489
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,130
Okay?

490
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:06,053
[door opens]

491
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:09,507
[door closes]

492
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,708
[Katharina] You've got the machine?

-[machine rattles]
-[quiet, tense music]

494
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,957
Do you know how to use it?

495
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:42,875
[Magnus] I...

496
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:44,837
I don't know.

497
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,633
Bartosz used it.

498
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,213
[mysterious music]

499
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:09,957
It's them.

500
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:13,837
Mikkel...

501
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,672
Dad, they're alive.

502
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:17,755
What?

503
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:20,668
They're just not here.

504
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,085
They're in another time.

505
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,800
[Claudia] Just grab your pills.
We'll get everything else later.

506
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I'll be needing a minute.

507
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:46,625
Come on, let's go.

508
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:50,755
I've been...

509
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:54,672
wondering why he returned to the cave.

510
00:42:57,713 --> 00:43:02,013
-Maybe there's something in the caves.
-Papa, give it a rest.

511
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:15,547
He tried it in '53 as well.

512
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,377
And now again.

513
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:23,375
-Maybe there is something...
-That isn't true.

514
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:27,553
But don't you think there has to be
a reason that he wanted to go in there?

515
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:32,455
[drawer closes]

516
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:35,212
Can we leave?

517
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
[breathing heavily]

518
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,258
Why are you really here?

519
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:56,045
What are you saying?

520
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:58,342
You knew this!

521
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,127
I knew what?

522
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,763
You know about time travel!

523
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:08,668
The nuclear plant is connected to it.

524
00:44:08,755 --> 00:44:10,625
How about we go now?

525
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,125
[whispers] I know you're a part of this.

526
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:20,755
Don't be ridiculous.

527
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,837
We must have the caves searched, then.

528
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:29,592
There's nothing in the caves!
There is no time travel!

529
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,130
[unsettling music]

530
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:51,258
-What are you doing?
-Calling the station.

531
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,508
We have to go search the caves.

532
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:57,667
You have no idea.

533
00:44:57,755 --> 00:45:01,415
The thing inside the caves
is beyond any other scientific discovery.

534
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:04,875
It turns everything we know
about the universe upside down.

535
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:08,963
And you're willing to jeopardize that?
For nothing?

536
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,510
You know, you haven't changed at all.

537
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,707
You are all you've ever cared about.

538
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:25,877
You have no heart!

539
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:31,167
Let go.

540
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:32,415
Let go!

[gasps softly]

544
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,127
Stay right there.

545
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,882
Don't move.

546
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,882
I...

547
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:56,132
I'll call an ambulance.

548
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:01,628
[Claudia breathes heavily]

549
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:06,707
Come on!
