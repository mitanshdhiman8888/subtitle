1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:14,923
Black holes are considered to be
the hellmouths of the universe.

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,075
Those who fall inside disappear.

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,631
Forever.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,630
But whereto?

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,583
What lies behind a black hole?

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,376
WHERE (WHEN) IS MIKKEL?

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,378
Along with things,
do space and time also vanish there?

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,458
Or would space and time

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,291
be tied together
and be part of an endless cycle?

10
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:48,326
What if everything that came from the past

11
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,881
were influenced by the future?

12
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,461
Tick-tock.

13
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,498
Tick-tock.

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,333
Tick-tock.

15
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,075
Tick-tock.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,833
Tick-tock.

17
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,165
Tick-tock.

18
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,461
DOUBLE LIVES

19
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,626
The sneaky little bitch.

20
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,628
Elli! Where's my lipstick?

21
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,253
-Good morning.
-Morning.

22
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,383
I'm going to stop by the home
to see Dad before work.

23
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,288
Okay.

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,831
I'll take Elisabeth to school.

25
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,666
I don't want her to go by herself.

26
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,788
All right.

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,421
WINDEN CAVES

28
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,375
WHERE IS THE CROSSING?

29
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,251
There you are, you stupid cow!

30
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,580
Where's my red lipstick?

31
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,826
I don't have your stupid lipstick.

32
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,576
I'm only eight. I don't use lipstick.

33
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,746
You may be able
to fool those two upstairs

34
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,543
with your puppy-dog eyes

35
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,875
and your pitiful deaf-and-dumb act,

36
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,958
but I don't buy it.

37
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,245
Have you packed your backpack?
I'll drive you.

38
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,536
Shall I take you too?

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,035
Am I a baby or what?

40
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,378
Because of Mikkel?

41
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,245
Yes, because of Mikkel.

42
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,248
Do you know who stole him?

43
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,293
I won't discuss police work with you.

44
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,036
I don't like Mikkel.
He's a show-off and a jerk.

45
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,288
I don't really care if he ever comes back.

46
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:54,955
Hey!

47
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,825
Where are you going?

48
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,333
To school.

49
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,536
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,125
I can call them.

51
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm fine.

52
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,955
Jonas?

53
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,291
We could also do something nice together.

54
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,878
Just the two of us.

55
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,421
Mom.

56
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,633
Okay.

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,133
REST HOME WINDEN

58
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,713
Dad?

59
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,665
You can't keep walking off.

60
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,081
I have to tell him.

61
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,880
Tell who what?

62
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,380
I have to tell him.

63
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,128
It has to stop.

64
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,291
It has to stop.

65
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,665
It has to...

66
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,041
What has to stop?

67
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,125
Tick-tock.

68
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,081
Don't be sad.

69
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,575
Weeks ago, in the small town of Winden,

70
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,456
a 15-year-old boy disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

71
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,831
MISSING

72
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,128
Residents are now alarmed
after a second child has gone missing.

73
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,790
11-year-old Mikkel
has been missing for two days.

74
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,915
Please report any relevant information
to the Winden police.

75
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,745
There have been repeated blackouts
in recent months

76
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,705
Security and public facilities

77
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,251
have not yet been...

78
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,378
However,
power grid operators are promising

79
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:17,538
to find the cause of the cuts and ask
the public to report further incidents.

80
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,415
CAUTION!
WILDLIFE OBSERVATION CAMERA

81
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,003
Did you just steal something?

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,290
I confiscated something,
there's a big difference.

83
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,173
Whatever you call it,
it's still the same thing.

84
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,250
I'll pick you up afterwards.

85
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,883
I want you to wait for me, okay?

86
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,040
What did I just say?

87
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,705
That you'll pick me up.

88
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:08,916
Who's he?

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yasin. We're dating.

90
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,288
You're doing what?

91
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,785
Yasin is my boyfriend.

92
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,535
That's how you say it nowadays.

93
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,205
Well then...

94
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,748
A web of symbols and references

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,540
runs through the novel.

96
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,955
The "sycamores by the sea" are an example
of this plethora of symbolism.

97
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,711
A special form of repetition
in Goethe's work is what we call doubling.

98
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,581
The characters
consciously and unconsciously...

99
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,576
Magnus, this isn't your class.

100
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,205
Won't you continue?

101
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,455
Where was I...?

102
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,961
Symmetry is a special kind of doubling.

103
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,126
The repetition is mirrored
along a central axis.

104
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,326
So, the repetition begins
at an imaginary center point

105
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,626
and branches off
in two opposing directions.

106
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,668
There are several encrypted references
to later events in the novel.

107
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
Ottilie's starvation, for example,

108
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,333
is referenced
in the third chapter of part one,

109
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,666
as her "excessive abstemiousness
in eating and drinking."

110
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,290
This reference is again repeated later.

111
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,286
I have to go to the bathroom.

112
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,421
Yes. Sure.

113
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,250
I'm no ornithologist, but...

114
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,333
these white speckles on the feathers

115
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,166
are not typical of this species.

116
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,126
Let's have a look at what killed you.

117
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,130
Any news on the boy?

118
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,583
Mikkel?
Disappeared off the face of the earth.

119
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,956
No, not Mikkel. The dead boy.

120
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,211
Oh, yes.

121
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,463
No.

122
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,171
We ran everything through
the missing persons database. No match.

123
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,250
Everything okay with you?

124
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,631
Yeah...

125
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,916
No.

126
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,036
I've seen spots like that
on feathers before.

127
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,286
Thirty-three years ago.

128
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,538
As if all this has happened before.

129
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,583
The children,

130
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,960
the birds...

131
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,290
Somehow it's all connected.

132
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,955
I just don't know how.

133
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,625
Where have you been?
The phones have been ringing all morning.

134
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,998
Someone must've said something
about the dead boy.

135
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,383
What am I supposed to say?

136
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,168
-Is Ulrich here?
-No, why?

137
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,080
Go through
the missing persons database again.

138
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,496
Include older reports this time.

139
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,498
He may have disappeared a long time ago.
Check the last 15 years, okay?

140
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,331
Right, okay.

141
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,626
-Anything else?
-No. Actually, there is.

142
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,078
The red soil...

143
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,166
We can't find any.
Not anywhere close to where he was found.

144
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,130
It must've come from the crime scene.

145
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,128
Get Jankowski to look into it.

146
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,078
And what do we say about the dead boy?

147
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,995
What time is it?

148
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,291
Just past ten.

149
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,498
Charlotte called.

150
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,378
She still doesn't have
a search warrant for the power plant.

151
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,461
It's been nearly 36 hours, Ulrich.

152
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:48,788
MISSING

153
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,826
TIME OF DISAPPEARANCE 9:30 - 10:30 PM

154
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,126
Should I continue with the tire tracks?
Seeing as Ulrich isn't in yet.

155
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,580
Tire tracks?

156
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,495
The treads we found on the road
the day Erik disappeared.

157
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,083
No, I'll do that myself.

158
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,036
-I can take it off your hands...
-I'll do it!

159
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Okay.

160
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,206
-What's...
-A screenshot from a wildlife camera.

161
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,421
I thought it might give us something.

162
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,035
Are you done with the database?

163
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,958
No.

164
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,711
Then why are you asking me
about tire tracks?

165
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,461
Fine.

166
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,788
Charlotte?

167
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,788
Is everything okay?

168
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,375
I missed your call
on the evening Mikkel disappeared.

169
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,378
I never asked why you called.

170
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,333
Why did you call?

171
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,496
I...

172
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,746
I don't know, I...

173
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,503
I think I was just calling
to say I'd be home late.

174
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,833
Nothing special.

175
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,878
You were at the office
all day on Monday?

176
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,630
Yes... Yeah.

177
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,535
I was writing reports

178
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,285
until around ten in the evening.

179
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,205
Why do you ask?

180
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,921
TIME OF DISAPPEARANCE 9:30 - 10:30 PM

181
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,125
No reason.

182
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,076
I had something mailed to the office,

183
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,206
and I'd forgotten about it.
I was just wondering if it arrived.

184
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,920
We haven't received anything.

185
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,711
Okay.

186
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,833
Okay.

187
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,923
I'm allowed to be parked here.

188
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,876
I want to know
if Peter Doppler was one of your clients.

189
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,415
Last Monday.

190
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,825
Can I see your badge again?

191
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,126
Charlotte Doppler.

192
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,543
Is it a private or professional question?

193
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,133
Does it make any difference?

194
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,665
Was he here on Monday?

195
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,918
Not necessary.

196
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,793
I never forget a dick.

197
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,543
Peter's is slightly crooked,
like a dill pickle.

198
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,535
Feels weird in the mouth.

199
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,745
-You probably know that already.
-Was he here on Monday or not?

200
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,496
No, he hasn't been back in over a year.

201
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,961
He must get what he needs
somewhere else now.

202
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:05,961
Thanks.

203
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,830
Fuck.

204
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,750
The beginning is the end,

205
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,963
-and the end is the beginning.
- Shit.

206
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,750
The beginning is the end,

207
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,668
and the end is the beginning.

208
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,580
The beginning is the end...

209
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,995
I left my kids at home today.

210
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,746
My mom's there.

211
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,961
She's looking after them.

212
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,213
Supposedly they found
a body in the forest.

213
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,746
You see...

214
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,630
I have this pathologist friend, he said...

215
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,668
it's terribly mutilated.

216
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,038
-Yup?
-Guess what?

217
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,415
-The bird has the same thing.
-Has what?

218
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,416
Burst eardrums on both sides.

219
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,750
-And that's how it died?
-No.

220
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:39,833
It probably died from losing its bearings
and crashing into the ground.

221
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,036
Cracked skull.

222
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:45,415
It happens often. Electromagnetic fields
interfere with their sensory systems.

223
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,130
-High voltage power lines?
-No.

224
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,628
We're talking voltages
in the radio wave spectrum.

225
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:50,958
Electrical appliances.

226
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:54,001
-And the white spots in the feathers?
-The white spots...

227
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,293
They started appearing after Chernobyl.
It's a kind of mutation.

228
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,075
Radiation contamination?

229
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,496
I checked,
but the radiation levels are normal.

230
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,575
-Interesting.
-It sure is.

231
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,038
-Anything else?
-Nope.

232
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,918
And did you know the girl snails
bite the willies off the boy snails?

233
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,130
You definitely made that one up.

234
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:22,791
I didn't. Then the boys
keep crawling on as girls. No joke.

235
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,035
-Where did you come up with that?
-Hey!

236
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,125
-There you are, Yasin.
-Television.

237
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,880
Let's go. Grandma's waiting.

238
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,206
Should I give you a ride home?

239
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,583
My mom's picking me up.

240
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,576
I'll drive you home.

241
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,328
It's no problem.

242
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:49,036
My mom will be here any moment now.

243
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,075
She's the Chief of Police.

244
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,670
Okay.

245
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:55,626
Come on.

246
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,628
Yes?

247
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,628
He did what?

248
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,498
What the fuck?

249
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,628
What's this?

250
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,626
Money, you idiot. My money.

251
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,000
Why do you have so much money?

252
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,170
Are you dealing drugs?

253
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,880
Is that why you were at the caves?

254
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,328
How I earn my money
is none of your damn business.

255
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,328
What are you going to do with it?

256
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,995
What am I going to do with it?
I'm getting out of this phoney shithole.

257
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,633
Behind everyone's friendly smile
there's nothing but lies.

258
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,630
You're no different.

259
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,288
You pretend to be the straight-A student,
but that's not you.

260
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,541
-Maybe you should start telling the truth.
-You want the truth?

261
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,625
Fine.

262
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,325
My parents have slept
in different beds for over a year.

263
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,828
My mom found out
that Dad's actually into dicks.

264
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,785
Their marriage is over,
but no one will say it.

265
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,961
Instead, this big fat secret
is always with us at the table.

266
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,581
It eats our bread rolls,
the butter and the homemade jam.

267
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,130
It gets fatter and fatter,
until there's no space left in the room.

268
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,415
Until you can't breathe.

269
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,080
-Did you forget something?
-No.

270
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,078
You have to pick up Elisabeth from school.
I can't make it.

271
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,420
I have a patient.
I have to go to the office.

272
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,828
Just pick her up, okay?

273
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,496
She can wait at your office.

274
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,665
I have to go to the power plant.

275
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,581
Okay, I'll...

276
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,831
I'll pick her up.

277
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,076
Thank you.

278
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,326
Was that it?

279
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,456
Wait.

280
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,251
You made me a promise a year ago.

281
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,080
If there's anything at all
you want to tell me...

282
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,133
Hey, I really have to get going,
or else I'll be late.

283
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,133
Tick-tock.

284
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:30,955
Excuse me.

285
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,078
I'm here to pick up Elisabeth.

286
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,285
I thought she had already been picked up.

287
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,205
What?

288
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,251
Mrs. Clemens is sick.
School finished at two today.

289
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,541
Didn't Elisabeth tell you?

290
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,673
It was written in her homework book.

291
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:01,578
Security found him on our grounds,
close to the caves.

292
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,961
He must've climbed over the fence.

293
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,040
He hasn't been very cooperative.

294
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,083
You're lucky
Aleksander isn't pressing charges.

295
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,498
Everyone understands your situation.
Everyone.

296
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,791
But climbing over the fence?

297
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,708
Understanding is nice, thank you.

298
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,495
But it's not enough.

299
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,131
My child is gone, okay?

300
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,248
This isn't just some file on your desk.

301
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,833
It's my child.

302
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,958
Why Mikkel?

303
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,501
I keep asking myself that.
Why him? Why my son?

304
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,503
Why not his son?

305
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,133
Why not his?

306
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,288
I'm being punished.

307
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,630
And all I get is fucking sympathy.
Well, you can take that and shove it.

308
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,248
Where's the search warrant?

309
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,293
Why is no one doing anything?

310
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,878
Should I tell you why?
Because it's not his kid.

311
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,126
And because it's not your kid.

312
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,130
Stop here, I want to get out.

313
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,380
Stop the car!

314
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:55,041
-Yes?
-Elisabeth wasn't there.

315
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,245
What do you mean not there?

316
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,333
She wasn't at school.

317
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,286
Mrs. Clemens is sick.

318
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,375
She wasn't waiting there.

319
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,958
I've been up and down the forest road
twice already, but she's not here.

320
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,376
Maybe someone from school took her home?
Maybe Yasin?

321
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,878
Go back home.

322
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,788
Maybe she went a different way.
Call everyone in her class.

323
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,920
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

324
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,746
Yes, all right.

325
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,961
Thank you.

326
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,791
I've called everyone on the list.

327
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,575
Nothing.

328
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,995
I have to tell him.

329
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,206
He has to stop.

330
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,788
I lost my hat.

331
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,128
Where were you?

332
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,826
You didn't pick me up, so I walked.

333
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,460
And that took you this long?

334
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,383
I met someone.

335
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,706
He gave me this.

336
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,330
Who did?

337
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,376
Ouch! You're hurting me.

338
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,418
I want to know who gave this to you.

339
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,540
Noah.

340
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,751
Who is Noah?

341
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,673
He said it used to belong to you.

342
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,785
-You are all cold...
- Elli?

343
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,131
Elli, is that you?

344
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,916
I was so worried about you.

345
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,458
Where were you?

346
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,876
Hands off my stuff!

347
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,541
Hello?

348
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,038
Yes.

349
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,125
No, she's here now.

350
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,498
Just now.

351
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:57,631
What?

352
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,713
Yes, I'll be right there.

353
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:07,291
Wöller found Helge in the woods.

354
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,538
FOR CHARLOTTE

355
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:25,326
We're searching for Ariadne's thread,

356
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:29,753
the one meant
to guide us along the right path.

357
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,875
A beacon in the darkness.

358
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,000
We'd love to know our fate.

359
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,173
Where we're headed.

360
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:50,955
But the truth is that there is
but one path through all times.

361
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:56,668
Predetermined by the beginning

362
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,790
and by the end.

00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,828
He has to stop.

365
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,170
Who has to stop?

00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,960
I have to stop him.

367
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,463
Stop whom?

368
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,288
Noah.

00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,581

00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,000
