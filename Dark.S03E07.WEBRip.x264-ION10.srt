1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,330
<i>What is reality?</i>

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,076
<i>And is there only one of them?</i>

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:19,416
<i>Or do several realities coexist?</i>

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,916
<i>To help explain, Erwin Schroedinger</i>

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,130
<i>devised an extremely interesting</i>
<i>thought experiment.</i>

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,630
<i>Schroedinger's cat.</i>

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,076
<i>A cat is locked in a steel chamber</i>

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,876
<i>with a tiny amount</i>
<i>of radioactive substance,</i>

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,790
<i>a Geiger counter,</i>
<i>a vial of poison, and a hammer.</i>

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,170
<i>As soon as a radioactive atom decays</i>
<i>inside the steel chamber,</i>

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,580
<i>the Geiger counter releases the hammer,</i>
<i>which smashes the vial of poison.</i>

12
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,996
<i>The cat is dead.</i>

13
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,581
<i>However,</i>

14
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:00,126
due to the wave characteristics
in the quantum world,

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,460
the atom has both decayed and not decayed,

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,833
until our own observation
forces it into a definitive state.

17
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,293
until the instant we look and see,
we don't know

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,245
if the cat is dead or alive.

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,748
It exists in two superposed states.

20
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,288
The properties "dead"

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,076
and "alive"

22
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,828
therefore exist simultaneously
in the microcosm.

23
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:43,083
<i>But what if the simultaneous existence</i>
<i>of life and death</i>

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,455
<i>also applied to the macrocosmic world?</i>

25
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,165
I'll make this right.

26
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,881
<i>Could two different realities</i>
<i>potentially exist side by side?</i>

27
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,383
<i>Could we manage to split time</i>

28
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,128
<i>and allow it run</i>
<i>in two opposing directions?</i>

29
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,626
And by doing so, allow the cat

30
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,916
to simultaneously exist in both states,
dead and alive?

31
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,328
<i>And, if so,</i>

32
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,671
<i>how many different realities...</i>

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,290
<i>could exist side by side?</i>

34
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,455
Martha!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Wait!

36
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,455
You can't go in there.

37
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,958
Bartosz?

38
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,293
-What are you doing here?
-Adam and the others lied to you.

39
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,785
He doesn't want to help you.
He's going to kill you.

40
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,876
In the future.
He doesn't want to stop the apocalypse.

41
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,753
Everyone will die.

42
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,633
Not because of you, but because of him.

43
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,165
I know what the origin is.

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,210
And how it's all connected.

45
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,498
Please.

46
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,543
I can show you.

47
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
You've got to trust me.

48
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:19,495
IN BETWEEN TIME

49
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,206
<i>It's hard for people to accept death.</i>

50
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,078
TANNHAUS FAMILY: NOVEMBER 8, 1971
MAREK, SONJA, CHARLOTTE

51
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,536
<i>We hold on tightly to things</i>
<i>that are long gone.</i>

52
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,923
CHARLOTTE
MAY 30, 1971

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,500
<i>We long in vain</i>
<i>for a way to turn back time.</i>

54
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,668
<i>A way to reverse death.</i>

55
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,460
<i>But if time is relative</i>

56
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,421
<i>and nothing is really ever in the past,</i>

57
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:46,576
<i>and the simultaneous overlapping</i>
<i>of different realities is possible,</i>

58
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,253
<i>shouldn't it then be possible</i>

59
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,673
<i>to bring back something</i>
<i>that was believed to be dead long ago</i>

60
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,825
<i>and to create a new reality</i>
<i>in which what is dead lives again?</i>

61
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,415
<i>If our life is defined as that</i>

62
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,130
<i>which lies between birth and death,</i>

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,250
<i>then it exists there in infinite versions.</i>

64
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,326
<i>Could we succeed in cheating death</i>

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,170
<i>by finding a way</i>

66
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,881
<i>to bring back life?</i>

67
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,786
<i>There, between time.</i>

68
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:21,081
FOR CHARLOTTE

69
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,878
Tell me about paradise.

70
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,080
Paradise...

71
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,830
is free

72
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,503
of pain and suffering.

73
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,576
Everything we've ever done...

74
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,541
is forgotten there.

75
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,378
Any pain...

76
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,290
we've ever felt...

77
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,415
is erased.

78
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,830
And...

79
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,415
all the dead...

80
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,920
live.

81
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,293
Adam will keep his promise.

82
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,705
The passage will open.

83
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,205
What do you want?

84
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,878
You've been promising us
there's a way out of here for ages.

85
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,328
That we can stop the apocalypse.

86
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,458
But you still don't know
how the portal works.

87
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,040
It will work.

88
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,963
I saw it work.

89
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,878
In the future.

90
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,456
And then what?

91
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,286
When are you finally going
to tell us the truth?

92
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,075
You don't want to go back.

93
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,251
You don't want
to stop the apocalypse at all.

94
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
This is bigger than us.

95
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,956
Bigger than the apocalypse.

96
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,211
If the portal works,
we can use it to find the origin.

97
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,125
The one moment that started all this.

98
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,081
And when we've found it, we'll destroy it.

99
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,788
And everything that arises from it.

100
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,328
That is paradise.

101
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,211
Paradise?

102
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,375
We've been stuck here for two years.

103
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,498
Two fucking years!

104
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,878
I don't want your fucking paradise.

105
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,578
I just want out of here.

106
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,633
Hello?

107
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,670
I... didn't mean to startle you.

108
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,745
Sometimes I think
it'll never stop raining.

109
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,633
I'm...

110
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,416
Silja.

111
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,333
Bartosz.

112
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,285
We can start
a new series of experiments tomorrow.

113
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,538
I know we've been trying for a long time,

114
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,581
but it will work.

115
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,878
Jonas.

116
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,083
You can't lose hope.

117
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,961
I can't do this anymore.

118
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,880
What are you doing here?

119
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,708
Are you following me?

120
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,825
You promised me something.

121
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,245
Adam promised me something.

122
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,133
You said the apocalypse must happen.

123
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,128
So that we can be saved.

124
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,498
So that all of us will be saved.

125
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,081
You can't die.

126
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,038
You can't take your own life.

127
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,330
Because your older self already exists.

128
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,128
Time won't allow it.

129
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,995
No matter what you try...

130
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,381
something...

131
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,918
or someone...

132
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,416
will always stop you from doing it.

133
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,706
Elisabeth and I,

134
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750
we found the passage.

135
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,543
You must keep your promise.

136
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,876
It will open again.

137
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,503
And then you will...

138
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,170
Then Adam will...

139
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,705
lead us to paradise.

140
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,830
He said we will become friends.

141
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,713
Before you betray me.

142
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,918
Yes! Good.

143
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,833
Once more.

144
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,000
Once more.

145
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,543
Yes! Yes!

146
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,750
It's a boy.

147
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,631
What will you name him?

148
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,631
Hanno.

149
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,881
<i>Fate is playing a cruel game with us.</i>

150
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
<i>Yet we will always believe there is</i>
<i>a way to turn the tide in our favor.</i>

151
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,503
<i>If only we want it badly enough.</i>

152
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:47,035
<i>A person is able to pursue a goal,</i>
<i>no matter how unattainable it may seem,</i>

153
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,458
<i>over the course of an entire lifetime.</i>

154
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,211
<i>No resistance, no obstacle is great enough</i>

155
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,461
<i>to stop one from pursuing one's will.</i>

156
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,706
<i>Is this stubbornness in our striving</i>

157
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:09,581
<i>not that which distinguishes us</i>
<i>from animals,</i>

158
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,876
<i>which know only short-lived desire?</i>

159
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,671
<i>And isn't all progress, through all ages,</i>

160
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,380
<i>not the product</i>
<i>of this unquenchable act of will?</i>

161
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,875
<i>No matter what motivates our will,</i>

162
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:35,998
<i>it will guide us on our path.</i>

163
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,920
<i>We will only be able to let go</i>

164
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,670
<i>when we have finally attained our goal</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

165
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,328
Why do you think it's not working?

166
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,383
Maybe Claudia doesn't want it to work.

167
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,245
Why do you even trust her?

168
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,125
Why did you trust him?

169
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,248
Adam?

170
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,833
He lied to you.

171
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,460
There is no paradise.

172
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,125
There's no world other than this one.

173
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,383
I know you think I will become him.

174
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,628
But I won't.

175
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,130
The portal will work, I've seen it.

176
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,628
In the future.

177
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,293
Everything repeats itself.

178
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,076
But if I can travel back,
I can change everything.

179
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,460
My older self tried it before,

180
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,883
but this time, everything's different.

181
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,915
I've changed the components
in the passage.

182
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,580
This time, it'll work.

183
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,880
She told you that?

184
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,168
Claudia?

185
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,248
What do you really know about her?

186
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,961
She sometimes disappears for days.

187
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,786
How does she know
all the things she knows?

188
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,543
She said
not everything that's here belongs here.

189
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,880
What did she mean by that?

190
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,333
Come inside.

191
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,075
Claudia's hiding something from us.

192
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,583
We can't trust her.

193
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,001
I hope you know that.

194
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,288
<i>He still doesn't suspect anything?</i>

195
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,208
<i>No.</i>

196
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,668
<i>He has no idea you</i>
<i>or the other world exists.</i>

197
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,630
You must continue
to guide him on his path.

198
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,251
The matter, it must not work yet.

199
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:46,326
You uphold the knot in your world,
and I'll uphold it in mine.

200
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,041
Wait.

201
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,380
All these past few years,
the things Eva said I had to do...

202
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,955
Does she know everything that happens?

203
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,463
I was wondering.

204
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,211
Have you ever met her?

205
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,291
Who?

206
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,461
My older self.

207
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,581
No.

208
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,040
I still remember exactly what she said.

209
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,826
"If everything goes right...

210
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:31,211
Regina will live."

211
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,915
I've thought about that all these years.

212
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,671
I just can't believe
that by that she meant

213
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,460
her suffering was to repeat
over and over forever.

214
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,418
There must be a way to untie the knot...

215
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,578
without destroying all life in it.

216
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,503
A way for Regina to live.

217
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:03,828
Really live.

218
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,293
I think
neither Eva nor Adam know that path.

219
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,326
But I'll find it.

220
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,923
In my world or yours.

221
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,170
Don't...

222
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,786
You didn't bring Claudia with you?

223
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,130
Noah is watching her.

224
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,995
We have to be careful.

225
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,206
You must give this to Claudia.

226
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,003
And she must give it to Tannhaus.

227
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,496
She understands

228
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,171
why it's necessary?

229
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,625
Why everything has to happen again?

230
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,381
You have to be strong now, Hanno.

231
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,496
For your father too.

232
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,915
Silja...

233
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,245
Bartosz, we tried everything.

234
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,825
She wanted to name her Agnes.

235
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,383
Tell me about paradise.

236
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,290
Paradise...

237
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,040
is free

238
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:18,626
of pain and suffering.

239
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:24,916
Everything we've ever done...

240
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,665
is forgotten there.

241
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,708
The passage will open.

242
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,460
And then...

243
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,251
we will be there.

244
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,665
You,

245
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,673
me...

246
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,706
and Charlotte.

247
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,875
Where is she?

248
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,125
Charlotte?

249
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
Where is Charlotte?

250
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,628
All these years,
I wondered what he meant by that.

251
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,581
That we'd be friends before you betray me.

252
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,706
Where's Claudia?
Does she have Charlotte? Did you help her?

253
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,746
I don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,790
Where is she?

255
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,130
Where's Charlotte?

256
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,705
I don't know.

257
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,495
I wish you all the suffering in the world.

258
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,211
I will find her.

259
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,043
I will bring her back.

260
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,331
I promise I will.

261
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,960
<i>A man can do what he wills,</i>

262
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,956
<i>but he cannot will what he wills.</i>

263
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:53,376
<i>All the paths we take in our lives,</i>

264
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,785
<i>every decision that we make,</i>

265
00:40:56,875 --> 00:41:01,825
<i>is guided by that which we desire</i>
<i>deep inside ourselves.</i>

266
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,455
<i>We cannot fight that desire.</i>

267
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,001
<i>It determines every one of our deeds,</i>

268
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:37,576
<i>no matter how grave and unimaginable</i>
<i>they seem.</i>

269
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,250
Hannah?

270
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,251
Silja?

271
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,166
I...

272
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,670
I'm looking for Jonas.

273
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,038
Yes.

274
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,628
He has changed.

275
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,793
Traveling has left its mark on him.

276
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:23,711
Jonas?

277
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,326
This is my daughter.

278
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:49,788
Silja.

279
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:54,576
She's your sister.

280
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,375
How did you find us?

281
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,128
A few days ago...

282
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,833
there was this old woman.

283
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,751
She just showed up on our doorstep.

284
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,540
Eva.

285
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,785
She said...

286
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,253
she knew where you were.

287
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,463
And that you were looking for me.

288
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,628
You're right.

289
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,211
It's all my fault.

290
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,288
I ruined everything.

291
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,963
But now I'm here.

292
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,165
I'm here, Jonas.

293
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:39,875
Bartosz.

294
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,583
Prepare the chamber for them.

295
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,206
What are you doing?

296
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,285
Silja.

297
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,331
She doesn't belong here.

298
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,171
What's that supposed to mean?

299
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,958
"She doesn't belong here"?

300
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,750
All the pieces have to be in position.

301
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,331
She's in the wrong place.

302
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,578
So are you.

303
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:13,788
Mom.

304
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,133
I want to show you a secret.

305
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,173
But we'll let your mom sleep, okay?

306
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,381
Come on.

307
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,415
I...

308
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,878
I have traveled far.

309
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,960
I need a place to sleep.

310
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,211
Hanno?

311
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,666
Prepare the chamber for this gentleman.

312
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,423
I was wondering when you'd come.

313
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,746
I know you think I lied to you.

314
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,875
That I took Charlotte away from you.

315
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:22,881
But I didn't.

316
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,876
You were right.

317
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,708
Claudia...

318
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,883
she lied to all of us.

319
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,288
The book...

320
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,205
Do you have it with you?

321
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,828
Are the last pages missing?

322
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,293
You must find the last pages.

323
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,003
They will lead you to Charlotte
and to your final destination.

324
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,628
You will find your paradise.

325
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,710
And Helge...

326
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,421
will help you do so.

327
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,535
Everything in life happens in cycles.

328
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,035
Sunset

329
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,583
is followed by sunrise,

330
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:37,876
over and over.

331
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,668
But this time...

332
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,165
it will be the last cycle.

333
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,750
Are you ready, Noah?

334
00:54:58,291 --> 00:54:59,751
The matter,

335
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,793
it can finally be stabilized.

336
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,961
Everything must happen again
in exactly the same way.

337
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:11,381
You have to lead your younger self
down the same path.

338
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,078
He must not act differently.

339
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,376
MISSING
MIKKEL NIELSEN

340
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,668
You have to set the course,
no matter how hard that may seem.

341
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,830
But you'll finally be able
to change everything.

342
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,126
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER

343
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,713
The device...

344
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,541
He'll repair it.

345
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,080
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

346
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,876
You must destroy the passage,
and the knot with it.

347
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,498
You'll succeed this time.

348
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,583
Jonas...

349
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,416
You must never lose hope.

<i>Weeks ago, in the small town of Winden,</i>

352
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,875

Hello, Claudia.

00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,958
Don't you want to get in?

358
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,418
You have to stop Adam.

359
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,998
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

360
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,288
Have we met?

361
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,920
I'm sorry.

Charlotte?

365
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,830
No, this can't be true.

366
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,673
Mom.

367
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,463
Jonas.

368
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,285
I've looked for you all these years.

369
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,035
You are not my father.

370
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,751
Regina?

371
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,995
I'm so sorry.

372
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,631
You used me.

373
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,710
<i>There is no man without guilt.</i>

374
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:22,245
None of them deserve
a place in your paradise.

375
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,035
Jonas?

376
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,131
And so the circle closes.

377
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,043
What about Martha?

378
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,125
Why did you bring me here?

379
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,213
They're the only ones who'll save us.

380
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,250
Save us?

381
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,461
Everything that's happened is their fault.

382
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,416
No.

383
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,495
They are the light.

384
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,000
What do you want from me?

385
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,916
Isn't it peculiar...

386
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,420
that one feels the greatest aversion

387
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,040
towards the people
who are most similar to oneself?

388
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,541
I'm not like you.

389
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,418
You and I have nothing in common.

390
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,416
My whole life, I believed

391
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,710
that this moment
could never repeat itself.

392
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,963
That I could never do

393
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,001
what my older self had done.

394
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,205
Because I couldn't understand

395
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:09,921
how I could ever want what she wanted.

396
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:11,955
But now...

397
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
66 years later, I understand.

398
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:25,291
Some pain is never forgotten.

399
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:29,581
It brands us for our entire life.

400
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,166
You and I...

401
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,825
we share that pain.

402
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,630
We bear the same scars.

403
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,035
A memento.

404
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:59,706
So you never forget
which side you really belong on.

405
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:06,921
You may not understand yet,
but choosing us is choosing life.

406
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,833
Choosing Adam is choosing death.

407
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
No!

408
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,331
No!

409
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:25,998
No!

410
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,825
This can't be.

411
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,165
Hello, Jonas.

412
