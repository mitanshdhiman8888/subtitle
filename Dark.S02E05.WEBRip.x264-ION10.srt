00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,508
It took me 66 years
to discover a way out of all this.

185
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,875
A way to finally leave this hell.

186
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,592
[Clausen] I've been here about a week,

187
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,130
and I get the impression
no one here is telling the truth.

188
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,673
Everyone's hiding something.

189
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:47,375
What I don't know is
whether everyone is hiding the same thing,

190
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:51,673
or if they all have their own skeletons
in the closet respectively.

191
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,627
Is he paying you?

192
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,170
Aleksander Tiedemann.

193
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't quite follow.

194
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:14,053
You worked for him as a physiotherapist.
You've stopped now, correct?

195
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,130
Mm-hmm.

196
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,713
And yet he still wires you
the same amount every month.

197
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:26,415
One would normally require a service
in return. What exactly is the service?

198
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,632
What you don't understand
is that we support each other.

199
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,087
We stick together here.

200
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:45,758
My son has disappeared.

201
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:49,507
Aleksander helps out with money.

202
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,127
That's all.

203
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,795
[Clausen] Nothing
beats a good neighborhood.

204
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,875
It's quite remarkable

205
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,263
that Mrs. Nielsen is
also so understanding.

206
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,093
Uh, maybe that's how it is
in small towns like this.

207
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,758
You don't just share secrets...

208
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,048
you also share your bed.

209
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,297
[eerie music]

210
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:57,302
-[Charlotte] I want to know what you know.
-[older Jonas] All right.

211
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,920
Who is Noah?

212
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,588
[older Jonas] He is one of them.

213
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,052
A traveler.

214
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,375
He's Adam's puppet.

215
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,505
He killed the children.

216
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,047
Mads, Erik, Yasin.

217
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:25,633
It seems like all of this
is somehow tied to me.

218
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:31,552
Do you know who my parents are?

219
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
No.

220
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,670
But I knew your grandfather.

221
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:44,208
He's not my real grandfather.

222
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,667
I just grew up with him.

223
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,667
Did he know all of this?

224
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,958
Is he one of them?

225
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,262
A traveler?

226
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,048
He's just a pawn, like most of us.

227
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,008
Claudia,

228
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,588
she used him,

229
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:11,172
like she used me, Peter and the others.

230
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,210
She had him build this.

231
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,455
[unlocking machine]

232
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:38,418
You know what will happen,
in the future?

233
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,458
Yes.

234
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:53,263
[low moan]

235
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,263
[Magnus] What is this?

236
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,420
Want another night, maybe?

237
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,335
Bartosz, look at us.
What are we doing here?

238
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,920
-Why won't you tell us what's going on?
-I would if I could.

239
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:23,207
I'm not allowed to.

240
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:26,757
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

241
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,838
Why wouldn't we?

242
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,090
Humans can survive three days
without any fluids or nourishment.

243
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,130
[Bartosz panting]

244
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,625
[Bartosz] You're crazy.
You can't do this.

245
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,963
Are you going
to leave me here to die or what?

246
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,880
[quietly] Hey, Martha.
Martha, please. Martha!

247
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:54,463
You can't do this, Martha! Martha!

248
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:55,797
Okay.

249
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,418
It's a time machine.

250
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:07,705
What?

251
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,298
Are you kidding me?

252
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,340
I told you
you wouldn't believe it.

253
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:19,798
Come on. We're leaving.

254
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,260
No. Wait.

255
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,130
Then show us how it works.

256
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,125
I need a phone.

257
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,303
-There's no reception.
-That doesn't matter.

258
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,962
It just needs to search for the signal.
That's all.

259
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,257
[quiet whizzing and rattling]

260

[crackling]

262
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:20,422
Come closer.

00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:22,842
[mysterious music]

264
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,422
[Claudia] The incident last summer...

265
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:42,585
You said it was the result of a reaction
in the volume control system.

266
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:47,093
I checked the data.
Everything was normal.

267
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,757
So?

268
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,417
What really happened?

269
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:02,132
I knew you'd always refuse to let this go.

270
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,460
After the incident,
I had a sample taken and analyzed.

271
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:12,167
What you see there are the results.

272
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,050
These values... They don't make sense.

273
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,210
I thought so too, initially.

274
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,090
So I had them run the tests another time.
The results were always the same.

275
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,918
If the data is correct, then...

276
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,300
-is this what I think it is?
-It's possible.

277
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,170
It corresponds in several ways
with the calculations

278
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,955
of Englert, Brout and Higgs.

279
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:40,087
In '64.

280
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,665
Ah, but not entirely.

281
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,420
The God Particle.

282
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,758
The particle
that gives all things the mass they have.

283
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,707
This is just sensational.

284
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:01,375
If this data is correct,
we have to make it available to everyone.

285
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:03,343
As I've told you before,

286
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,955
sometimes it's all right
to let sleeping dogs lie. Hmm?

287
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:14,418
If we make it public people will want
to know how we discovered it.

288
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,420
The nuclear plant

289
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,088
is my only legacy.

290
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,008
Do what you want with the data,

291
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,257
but just keep my name

292
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,588
and the plant out of it.

293
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,012
At least so long as I'm alive.

294
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,050
Are you all right?

295
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,840
Can I help you?

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,710

-Hmm?

In the '50s he supposedly killed two kids
and beat another one half to death.

303
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:06,758
He's on his last legs now,
but they say we should stay on alert.

That's what you said.

313
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:33,963
Do you recall?

[Jonas] In the future
there's a prophecy about a new world.

317

That Sic Mundus
will lead mankind to paradise.

318
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,210
Is that this?

319
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:03,963
A religion?

320
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:07,208
We're the exact antithesis of that.

321
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,340
We've declared war on time.

322
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,762
God is our antagonist.

323
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:18,048
We are creating a new world.

324
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,130
Without time.

325
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:21,383
Without God.

326
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,802
How is that?

00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:30,047
In short, the god mankind
has prayed to for thousands of years

328
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,300
the god that everything is bound with,

329
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,550
this god exists as nothing
other than time itself.

330
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,673
Not a thinking, acting entity.

331
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,165
A physical principle
with which you can no more negotiate

332
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,915
than you could with your own fate.

333

God...

334
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,757
is time.

00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,755
And time is not compassionate.

that I only did all this to finally put
a stop to everything once and for all.

So you won't be taken from me again.

You were so strong.

Your little hand grabbed my finger
and wouldn't let go of it.

that were going to happen.

Michael, our father,

446
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,338
is just a small part of a knot

447
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:52,672
that is infinitely greater
and more convoluted.

448
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:57,837
The entire universe
is nothing but a giant knot

449
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:00,422
from which there is no escape.

450
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,627
If that's the case,

451
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,457
if everything is tied forever
in this knot,

452
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:11,837
if nothing can change... then haven't you
already had this conversation?

453
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,422
And asked that very question.

454
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,920
All my life I was convinced that...

455
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,418
this moment here

456
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,550
could never be repeated this way.

457
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,762
I would never be able to say the words

458
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:31,457
that my older self said to me back then.

459
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:36,672
Because I couldn't understand

460
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,632
how I could ever want

461
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,005
what he wanted.

462
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:46,837
Now,

463
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,457
66 years later, I understand.

464
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,510
There are moments that change us forever.

465
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,882
There is pain you never forget.

466
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:11,668
But there is also a way...

467
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:17,625
that leads out of all this gruesome,
senseless futility.

468
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:23,007
But if that's correct,
if there is an escape,

469
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:27,763
why is everything happening again,
why have you changed nothing?

470

is built on its predecessor.

then the automobile.

00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:26,963
People have given it
all sorts of names over the centuries.

544
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,167
Ether,

545
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:31,085
dark matter, Higgs field.

546
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:33,012
How was it created?

547
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:34,918
In the future,

548
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,295
by the catastrophe in two days
that you so dearly want to prevent.

549
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,047
This one

550
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,710
was created by us.

551
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:48,047
It is the continuation
of technical evolution.

552
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:50,012
And...

553
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:53,337
it will be the end of this knot.

554
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:58,673
This one will send you exactly to the day

555
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,513
that you want to travel to.

556
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:06,458
It will break the 33-year cycle.

557
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,802
That's why I'm here.

558
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,045
That's what you want from me.

559
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:17,335
The way to stop this all from happening
is for me to stop the very beginning.

560
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,880
That is right.

561
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:23,512
The question is, when is the beginning?

562
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:28,053
And what sacrifice must we make?

563
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:34,298
The 20th of June, 2019.

564
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:37,843
The day before it happened.

565
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,172
Before my dad committed suicide.

566
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:47,915
Before it all went to chaos.

567
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,165
If you can prevent him
from taking his own life,

568
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,300
then nothing that follows will occur.

569
00:51:00,088 --> 00:51:01,418
Mikkel

570
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:03,255
won't travel back.

571
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:07,378
You...

572
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:08,803
I...

573
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,258
will never be born.

574
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:16,457
But everyone else will live.

575
00:51:20,172 --> 00:51:22,632
Martha will live.

576
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,338
[whirring, bubbling]

577
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,340
[crackling]

578
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:49,213
[buzzing]

579
00:51:50,297 --> 00:51:52,007
[rumbling]

580
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:01,958
If you succeed,

581
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:05,302
we will reorder the whole world.

582
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,840
[whirring and banging]

583
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,255
[atmospheric music]
