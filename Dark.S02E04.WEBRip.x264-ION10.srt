00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,795
What do you know about him?

183
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,172
-He's one of them.
-What is this?

184
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,090
[Charlotte] One of whom?

185
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,630
Of Sic Mundus.

186
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,757
The travelers.

187
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,213
The travelers?

188
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,958
<i>Sic mundus creatus est?</i>

189
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,298
What are you talking about?
You knew all this?

190
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,837
The time travel.

191
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,013
There's something
I think you both should see.

192
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,088
[oppressive music]

193
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,755
Okay.

194
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,755
[quiet, suspenseful music]

195
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,415
You want to go in there?

196
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,875
After four children disappeared?

197
00:20:58,713 --> 00:20:59,883
[sighs]

198
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:10,705
You stay by me.
I'll make sure we're safe. Okay?

199

WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

[clears throat] Excuse me.

201
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,630
I'd like to learn about...

202
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,090
the town's history.

203
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,050
Where can I find articles and documents
of the last 30 years or so?

204
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,010
That's all digital now.

205
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,255
And where's that?

206
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,553
Excuse me.

207
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,132
Where is the keyboard?

208
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,627
There isn't one.

NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BOSS
DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE

213
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,550
[Clausen] Did you inform her
about the appointment?

214
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:57,423
[Wöller] Yes.

215

APPOINTMENTS

216
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,510
What do you know about Hannah Kahnwald?

217
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,422
Her husband committed suicide.

218
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,958
Hanged himself.

219
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
No one here understood
why she married him.

220
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,510
She was so pretty.
She could've had any man she wanted.

221
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:24,168
There were rumors that she had an affair
with Ulrich Nielsen.

222
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,207
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about that?

223
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,170
Can I ask you something?

224
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,008
Ask away.

225
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,585
How'd you get this position?

226
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,378
Special task force.

227
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:56,917
Did you volunteer for this?

228
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Oh, yes.

229
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,797
I did.

[sad piano music]

231
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,800
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

232
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,878
She told me and Tronte what we have to do.

233
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:44,418
Claudia Tiedemann.

234
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:46,875
She knew exactly at what time

235
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,553
things would happen.

236
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:53,335
It didn't make any sense, yet it was
the only way anything made sense.

237
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,513
You knew about all of this?

238
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,007
Michael, Mikkel, Ulrich?

239
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:05,047
About everything?

240
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:16,257
This here... She gave us this book.

241
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:21,125
It's all in there, about all the children.
Who disappeared when.

242
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,758
Things about time travel.

243
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,420
Symbols and tables
we can't quite understand.

244
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,463
-The last few pages were ripped out.
-Does Katharina know this?

245
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,960
Well, you have to tell her.

246
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,205
Okay.

247
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,207

ON JUNE 26, 1987

255
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:58,957
Excuse me.

256
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,342
Can I print off these things?

257
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,842
[quiet rumbling]

258
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,922

[Martha]<i> Sometimes I dream about him.</i>

260
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,550
Jonas.

261
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:58,957
It all feels so real.

262
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,505
As if he was still alive.

263
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,760
How could it feel that way
if he's really dead?

264
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,337
It's possible he knew something,
before he disappeared.

265
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,128
What are you saying?

266
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,840
What if he saw something
that he shouldn't have seen?

267
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,513
[Magnus] The door has to be
in this direction.

268
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:39,093
[blows]

269
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,553
[Katharina] Where are we going, Charlotte?

270
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,093
Tell me where we're going.

271
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,415
Damn it, Charlotte!
Where are you taking me?

272
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:11,005
It's easier to understand
if you just see it.

273
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,877
What have you found?

274
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,173
You found them.

275
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,463
We found them.

276
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,797
Both.

277
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,800
And they're not dead. They're still alive.

278
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,335
But they're not here.

279
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,045
They're not here?

280
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,550
But they're alive... What does that mean?

281
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:54,052
It's better if you see it
with your own eyes.

282
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,172
[suspenseful music]

283
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:06,512
[metal door creaks]

284
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,837
Why is she here?

285
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,923
What's all this about, Charlotte?

286
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,918
You said you thought Mikkel
went into the cave. You were right.

287
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,415
Mikkel was in the cave
and Ulrich was looking for him in there.

288
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,458
But they found something in the tunnels.

289
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:45,382
A kind of tear... in the fabric of time.

290
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,705
You can't be serious.

291
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,672
What is all this shit?

292
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,705
-Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
-[Hannah] It's true.

293
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:13,507
Stay out of this!
Nobody asked you for your opinion.

294
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,255
Charlotte is right.

295
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,762
Uh-huh. Another one?

296
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,165
And who are you? Her new boy toy?

297
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,420
I'm Jonas.

298
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,382
Her son.

299
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,213
And your grandson.

300
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:44,838
[scoffs, laughs]

301
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:13,963

[low rumbling]

303
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,625
She says it's shaking.

304
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,960
[rock crumbles]

305
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,962
-What is it?
-We're not alone.

306
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,093
Go. Go, go!

307
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,052
[quietly] turn off the lights.

308
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:03,377
[footsteps approaching]

309
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:15,422
[tension-filled music]

310
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,672
-Bartosz?
-[groans]

311
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,665
What are you doing here?

312
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:34,255
-[Bartosz] What the fuck?
-[Magnus grunting]

313
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,708
[Martha] Why are you here?

314
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:46,842
[Katharina] My husband is trapped
in the '50s, and my son in the '80s.

315
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,625
You chose to leave him there
because Mikkel is your father. That right?

316
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,208
Yes.

317
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,958
I can't take this seriously.
You're buying into all this bullshit?

318
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,838
What's in it for you? Huh?

319
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:16,707
Do you want money?
Can you speak with the dead? Yeah?

320
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,375
Katharina.

321
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:24,957
I was there.

322
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,550
I saw him there.

323
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,208
Mikkel.

324
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,338
[tense music]

325
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,340
You've all lost your minds.

326
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,835
[metal door creaks]

327
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,262

328
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:27,668
[suspenseful music]

329
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,798
No.

330
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,258
[grunting angrily]

331
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:33,455
[strained shouting]

332
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,380
[muffled, distorted chatter]

333
00:37:55,547 --> 00:37:58,707

00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,338
[muffled audio]

335
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:05,172
[muffled audio] Fuck you, Magnus! [grunts]

336
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,915
[Magnus] I swear to God, if you have
anything to do with this shit...

337
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,455
[Bartosz] Fuck you.

338
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:13,707
-Stop it.
-Tell us what the fuck you're doing here.

339
00:38:13,797 --> 00:38:15,547
[Bartosz groans]

340
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,958
Come here.

341
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,667
[low rumbling]

342
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,263
What is this thing?

343
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:41,257
-What is that?
-Don't touch it. It doesn't concern you.

344
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,915
[Magnus] If you have anything to do
with Mikkel or my dad...

345
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,550
I'm going to kill you.

346
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,132
What should we do now?

347
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,668
[Martha] We're taking it.

348
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,877
And him?

349
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,803
We leave him here.

350
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,457
Maybe that'll change his mind.

351
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,550
[Bartosz] Fuck.

352
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,090
You can't do this.

353
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:18,547
Martha! You can't do this!

354
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,593
Hey. Shit. Hey!

355
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,763
Magnus! Stop!

356
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,168
Magnus!

357
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,545
Magnus! [whimpers]

358
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,460
[groans softly]

359
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,165
[Clausen] What's your take on all of this?

360
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,665
