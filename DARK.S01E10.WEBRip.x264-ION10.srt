00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:15,043
THE DAY OF MIKKEL'S DISAPPEARANCE

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,671
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

3
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,793
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

4
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,793
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

5
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,995
the courage to change the things I can...

6
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,043
SCHOOL ID - MADS NIELSEN

7
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:11,995
Tronte!

8
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,830
I...

9
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,920
It's me, Peter.

10
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,670
I...

11
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,290
There's something here you should see.

12
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,916
It's to do with your son.

13
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,670
No, not Ulrich.

14
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:31,996
Mads.

15
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,923
How...

16
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,826
That's impossible.

17
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,248
That's impossible.

18
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,001
He was just there all of a sudden.

19
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,330
Mads.

20
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,666
Mads.

21
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,166
Someone's coming.

22
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:50,996
Tronte.

23
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,293
Claudia?

24
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,173
Peter.

25
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,828
There's a lot I have to explain.

26
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:15,495
But first we need to take Mads
to the place where he is to be found.

27
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,710
We don't have much time left.

28
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:55,536
ALPHA AND OMEGA

29
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,208
I'm sorry.

30
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,713
I really fucked up.

31
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,711
Since Mikkel disappeared...

32
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,165
I don't recognize myself anymore.

33
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,496
It doesn't matter, okay?

34
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,081
Everything's okay.

35
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,376
Everything's okay.

36
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,171
You know how he is.

37
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,250
He usually comes back after a few hours.

38
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,628
He's never been gone this long.

39
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,578
Was my colleague Ulrich Nielsen
here again?

40
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,460
No. Not that I'm aware of, anyway.

41
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,920
Only on Saturday,
when he lashed out at Mr. Doppler.

42
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,576
As if your father-in-law
had something to do with the case.

43
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,543
Did you know?

44
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,213
Did I know what?

45
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,165
The boy from the future.

46
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,875
You knew.

47
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,501
This is for you.

48
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,503
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

49
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,210
-That's impossible.
-What?

50
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,416
I burned it.

51
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,996
How long have you known?

52
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,328
I've always known, really.

53
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,036
When your father came to me,

54
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
he was a disturbed little boy.

55
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,076
I just thought
he had an overactive imagination.

56
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,461
That something bad must have happened
to him, something he couldn't bear.

57
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,541
He told me...

58
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,288
he came from the future.

59
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,625
I didn't believe him.

60
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458
If you knew...

61
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,213
why didn't you stop it?

62
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,166
I didn't know
that he would take his own life.

63
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,920
But you could have saved Mikkel!

64
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,575
Now I have another grandma
and she's the principal of my school!

65
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,543
Her husband, who's fucking my mom,
is looking for his son, who's my father!

66
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,876
A few days ago I kissed my aunt.

67
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,333
And the crazy thing is...

68
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,383
there's nothing wrong with any of them.

69
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,171
They're okay.

70
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,883
I'm what's wrong.

71
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,290
I think things...

72
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,455
no matter how abnormal

73
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,748
or strange they seem to us,

74
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,463
happen for a reason.

75
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,251
Who are we to play God?

76
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,285
What's past is past.

77
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,213
But you...

78
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,923
live in the here and now.

79
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,955
Who knows what the future will bring.

80
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,710
I just want everything
to go back to normal.

81
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,285
As a kid, all that Houdini dreamed of
was becoming a magician.

82
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,833
Do you have the same dream?

83
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,580
Yes.

84
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,211
But the magic I want to do is impossible.

85
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,251
Which is what?

86
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,423
I just want to finally wake up.

87
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,331
Have you heard of Master Zhuang's paradox?

88
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166
I dreamt I was a butterfly.

89
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,668
Now I've woken up
and no longer know if I'm a person

90
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,540
who dreamed he's a butterfly,

91
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,960
or if I'm a butterfly who's dreaming

92
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,958
it's a person.

93
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,670
What are you?

94
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,876
A person or a butterfly?

95
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,250
Maybe I'm both.

96
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,630
My name is Egon Tiedemann.

97
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,291
Maybe we can just start
with you telling me your name.

98
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,415
Tiedemann?

99
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,998
Egon, yes...

100
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,133
Of course.

101
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,753
-Are you a Satanist?
-A Satanist?

102
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,753
No, I'm a cop.

103
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,381
A cop?

104
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,575
It's a song from the 80s.

105
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,960
I can tell you now, you won't like it.

106
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,208
Look into the camera.

107
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,381
Why did you kill the children?

108
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,458
I didn't kill the children.
I tried to save them.

109
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958
What did you do to Helge?

110
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,248
He's still alive.

111
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,630
He must be.
Or the children wouldn't be dead.

112
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,208
Where is Helge now?

113
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,536
-Where is he?
-I can change it all.

114
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,705
I can change everything that's going
to happen, but you have to let me go.

115
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,828
-Look into the camera.
-Please!

116
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,166
Look into the camera!

117
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,830
You know what we do
with child murderers here?

118
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,456
You stupid asshole.

119
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,075
You're just as small-minded
as everyone else in this shitty town.

120
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,578
Let me go!

121
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,666
Are you already drinking, or will you
start after your wife leaves you,

122
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,040
and you realize
how pathetic and pitiful you are?

123
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,246
Let me go! Let me go!

124
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,293
Leave me! Let me out!

125
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,001
I need to get to my son.
I have to find my son!

126
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,535
I waited for you.

127
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,705
On Thursday.

128
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,421
-Yes, fuck...
-What do you mean "fuck"?

129
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,380
I didn't tell anyone
you were in the nuthouse.

130
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,173
I lied for you.

131
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,880
France, baguettes...

132
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
Blah, blah, blah...

133
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,168
Turns out you lie pretty well yourself.

134
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,580
You don't even need me.

135
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,498
Martha told me everything.

136
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,076
-It just happened. I really didn't...
-What didn't you want?

137
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,666
To blow me off?

138
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,040
To lie to me?

139
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,665
To make out with my girlfriend?

140
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
You're a sick piece of shit!

141
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,003
Just like your dad.

142
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,578
What are you doing?

143
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,831
Have you lost it?

144
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,325
Don't ever come back here!

145
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,583
Get the hell out of here!

146
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,825
You repaired it.

147
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,826
That one's yours.

148
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,078
And this one's mine.

149
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,955
I built it many years ago.

150
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,205
It's the same device,

151
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,421
but in a different condition.

152
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,003
You see.

153
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,706
It's as if

154
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,921
one could look at the beginning and end
of something at the same time.

155
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,671
Wait a moment.

156
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333
This thing here

157
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,705
it sends a kind of signal.

158
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,788
An electromagnetic impulse.

159
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,173
As if it were trying
to communicate with something.

160
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,920
And look at this.

161
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,538
This part has never moved.

162
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,415
It was included in the blueprint,
but I never knew what it was for.

163
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,750
This thing communicates with the device.

164
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,920
It's not just the past
that influences the future.

165
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,628
The future also influences the past.

166
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,633
You see.

167
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,290
If you hadn't shown me what the device
looks like in the future,

168
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,325
I wouldn't have been able to build it.

169
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,671
A paradox.

170
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,381
These openings

171
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,996
didn't exist either.

172
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,918
I have no idea what their purpose is.

173
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,631
What's that?

174
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
Cs-137.

175
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,961
A radioactive isotope of Cesium.

176
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,420
The device generates a Higgs field.

177
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,996
It increases the mass of the Cesium,

178
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,423
An electromagnetic impulse causes it

179
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
to implode into a black hole.

180
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,036
The same thing must have happened
during the nuclear power plant incident.

181
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,668
Why did you decide to help me after all?

182
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,381
Why?

183
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,205
That's a big word.

184
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,205
Why do we decide for one thing
and against another?

185
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,963
But does it matter
whether the decision is based upon

186
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:35,211
the consequence
of a series of causal links?

187
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,881
Or whether it stems from
an undefined feeling inside me?

188
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:47,793
That perhaps everything in my life
boils down to this one moment.

189
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,745
That I'm part of a puzzle.

190
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,793
One that I can neither understand

191
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,535
nor influence.

192
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,128
Will you tell me...

193
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,788
what the future's like?

194
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,786
I'm hoping that by tomorrow,
it'll already be different from today.

195
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,381
Yes?

196
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,001
Your father was kidnapped as a kid, right?

197
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,463
Do you remember when exactly?

198
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,923
I...

199
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,958
Can we talk? I...

200
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,496
- I have to tell you something...
-When exactly? '53? '54?

201
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,788
Fall of '53.

202
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:45,995
'53.

203
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,036
Exactly 66 years ago.

204
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,826
Two times 33.

205
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,036
- It's all connected.
-Listen, Charlotte, I...

206
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,035
I have to talk to you.

207
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,418
Later, okay? I've got to go.

208
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,460
Can I help you?

209
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,250
Were you looking for me?

210
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,625
You have to stop.

211
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,458
What do I have to stop?

212
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,500
He's using you.

213
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,711
All of his promises are lies.

214
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,956
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

215
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,673
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

216
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,040
I've said that before.

217
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,463
Everything Noah says

218
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,750
is a lie.

219
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,880
He's not the chosen one.

220
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,458
You're not the chosen one.

221
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,291
He doesn't want
to save the world from evil.

222
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,250
He is evil.

223
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,131
Today is the day.

224
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,628
The beginning and the end.

225
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,040
Don't make the same mistakes I made.

226
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,751
Don't make the same mistakes I made.

227
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500
You have to stop.

228
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,495
You have to stop!

229
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,418
I have to stop.

230
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,878
What happened to you?

231
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,078
I got into a fight.

232
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,708
What?

233
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,540
With whom?

234
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,213
It doesn't matter.

235
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,583
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

236
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,631
Everything will be fine.

237
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,535
I left something at school.

238
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,541
Don't worry. Everything will be fine, Mom.

239
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,745
Charlotte asked me about the cabin.

240
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,790
And Helge.

241
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,213
About what happened in '53.

242
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,830
A few more hours, and it'll be over.

243
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,625
Mads will live.

244
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,918
Do you believe her?

245
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:38,536
Everything she said would happen
has happened in the last eight days.

246
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,170
Just as it's written here.

247
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,790
Then why have half of the pages
been torn out?

248
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,456
What happens after today?

249
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,580
After today...

250
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,415
everything will be new.

251
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,750
But if there is no God,

252
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,131
then why do we believe in a lie?

253
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,536
Because we prefer any lie to the pain.

254
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,711
Years ago, I was still a little boy.

255
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,331
A stranger came to us.

256
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,083
He looked as if he'd been in the war.

257
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,538
Didn't talk much.

258
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,420
There was this sadness in his eyes.

259
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,880
The kind you sometimes see
in those who want to die,

260
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,078
but life won't let them.

261
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,916
He took a room in our house.

262
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,328
The bedroom right next to mine.

263
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,246
And...

264
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,498
sometimes I heard him talk in his sleep.

265
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,038
Confused words.

266
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,130
But one night, he was suddenly very clear.

267
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,415
He stood in the hallway,

268
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,330
his eyes wide open, and said...

269
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,460
"Nothing is in vain.

270
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,165
Not a single breath.

271
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,333
Not a single step, not a single word.

272
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,456
Not pain.

273
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,996
An eternal miracle of the One."

274
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,211
I didn't understand any of his words.

275
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,290
Only years later, when I felt the pain,

276
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,711
did I understand what he meant.

277
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:36,041
That none of the horrible things
that befall us should be in vain.

278
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,455
That's my son!

279
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,501
That they make us what we are.

280
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,540
That they give us our strength.

281
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,916
Your pain made you who you are, Helge.

282
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,668
But it no longer has power over you.

283
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,833
Who is next?

284
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,205
Jonas Kahnwald.

285
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,460
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

286
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,170
You can always come and visit him.

287
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,285
I'm taking you to your new home.

288
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,961
There are lots of other children there.

289
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,131
-Can you hear me?
-Come.

290
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,423
Come.

291
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,328
You know, I've made a decision.
I want to adopt him.

292
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,996
And to take provisional custody
of him during the adoption procedure...

293
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,383
I'm afraid it's not so easy.

294
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,328
I have references. I own a home.

295
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,076
-I...
-It's a very complicated process.

296
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,166
I know.

297
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,000
It may seem somewhat rash.

298
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,293
But it isn't.

299
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,325
-I can't just decide here...
-The boy likes me.

300
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,076
He trusts me.

301
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,753
I'm the only person
he lets close to him, and...

302
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,126
And I...

303
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,463
I like him, too.

304
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,130
What day is it today?

305
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,498
-The 12th.
-What year?

306
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,423
'86.

307
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
Are you from here?

308
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,833
What are you doing here?

309
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,875
Bringing someone back from the dead.

310
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,248
How does that work?

311
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,376
It's very hard to explain.

312
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,128
Can you bring these back?

313
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,075
No, you have to find them
when they're younger.

314
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,996
But then they're not dead yet.

315
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,538
That doesn't change the fact
that they will die.

316
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:53,995
You're crazy.

317
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,288
Maybe.

318
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,711
"Helge Doppler. Nine years old.

319
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,001
Went missing on November 10, 1953.

320
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,213
The kidnapping is being linked
to an unknown person."

321
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:20,745
Page five.

322
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,166
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

323
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,381
Let me go. Please!

324
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,995
Please, let me go.

325
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,333
Where is Helge?

326
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,786
You don't want to talk?

327
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,333
I'll teach you how to talk.

328
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,503
Who are you?

329
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,963
-There's no need to be afraid.
-Hey!

330
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,751
Hey! What's this supposed to be?
What is this?

331
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,785
Why did you lock me in here?

332
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,833
It wasn't me.

333
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,246
It was Noah.

334
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,633
Who's Noah?

335
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,248
Where am I? What is this?

336
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,626
This is a kind of prototype
of a time machine.

337
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,166
You're the guinea pig.

338
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:18,581
The passage in the cave
lies directly under this bunker.

339
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,036
If opened,
the energy flows through this room.

340
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,825
But it needs to be increased.

341
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,833
No DeLorean.

342
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,416
No hissing or steam.

343
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,250
The first time machine
is a bunker with four walls.

344
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,133
But it still doesn't quite work.

345
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,210
-Let me out of here.
-I can't.

346
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,375
It's the only way for things
to be normal again.

347
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,788
Who are you?

348
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,785
You don't know?

349
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,543
The letter.

350
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,583
You burned it.

351
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,041
And yet it still exists.

352
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,130
You'll carry that letter for almost 33 years
before you pass it on.

353
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,961
To yourself.

354
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,828
I am you.

355
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,325
My name is Jonas Kahnwald.

356
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,333
I sent the letter to you.

357
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,753
Or should I say, to me.

358
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,423
Everything you're experiencing,
I've already experienced.

359
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,916
I burned the letter, just like you.
I got it back from our grandmother.

360
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,960
I've already had this conversation.

361
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,881
But I was on the other side then.

362
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,460
We think we're free, but we're not.

363
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,461
We follow the same old path.

364
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,328
Again and again.

365
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,786
That's crazy!

366
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,713
It doesn't make any sense!

367
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,253
You can decide to let me go now.

368
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,165
Come on, let me out!

369
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,960
I thought it was crazy for a long time.
That I'm crazy.

370
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,625
But I can't let you out because then
you won't become what I am today.

371
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,958
If I now change my past,
I will change who I am right now.

372
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:07,251
And then I won't be able
to destroy the hole once and for all.

373
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,830
Why did you kiss Martha?

374
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:17,575
We're not free in what we do,
because we're not free in what we want.

375
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,746
-We can't overcome what's deep within us.
-Stop it.

376
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,673
Stop.

377
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,576
Please stop.

378
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,833
I have to bring Mikkel back.

379
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,996
I want everything to go back to normal.

380
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,083
I want all this sick shit to stop!

381
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,536
You still do.

382
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,205
Thirty-three years later.
I still want that.

383
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,076
But Mikkel...

384
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,753
Our father is just a small part
of a sprawling sickness.

385
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,383
I've seen things
that no one should ever see.

386
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,963
I'm sorry.

387
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,881
Wait.

388
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,498
Hey! Hey!

389
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,631
Stop!

390
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,921
Hey!

391
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:44,041
But a brief blink of an eye
And then returns the night

392
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:53,665
Somehow the future starts somewhere
Sometime

393
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,080
I won't wait for long

394
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:02,286
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

395
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:06,745
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

396
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:37,125
THURSDAY, NOV 13, 1986:
SEVERE ACCIDENT AT INTERSECTION

397
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,995
COME TO THE CABIN.
WE NEED TO TALK. PETER.

398
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,503
WHAT DOES NOAH WANT?

399
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,456
Everything is about to begin.

400
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,130
The older Jonas
will destroy the hole, but...

401
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,245
he doesn't realize that he will be the one

402
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,253
to trigger its existence.

403
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,083
A paradox.

404
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,918
The cesium in his useless machine

405
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,540
won't destroy the hole forever.

406
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,326
It's what creates it in the first place.

407
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,416
He thinks he's the savior.

408
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,793
But Claudia lied to him.

409
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,580
Most people are nothing
but pawns on a chessboard.

410
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,326
Led by an unknown hand.

411
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:54,166
Their lives exist
only to be sacrificed for a higher goal.

412
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,206
Jonas, Mikkel, the children,

413
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,421
they're nothing but unfortunate,
yet necessary chess moves

414
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,583
in an eternal war between good and evil.

415
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:12,538
There are two groups out there
fighting to control time travel.

416
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,995
Light and shadow.

417
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,290
We belong to the light.

418
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,495
Don't forget that.

419
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,328
Even though some of what we do
is of a dark nature.

420
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,081
But no victory is ever won
without sacrifice.

421
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,918
As long as we're in this time loop

422
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,540
we who know have to make sure
that every step will be repeated

423
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,625
exactly as it was before.

424
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,131
No matter how inhumane it seems to us.

425
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,248
No matter what sacrifices
it demands of us.

426
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,920
But believe me,

427
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,075
the others are the ones
who are truly inhumane.

428
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,708
They have lost all humanity.
They belong to the shadow.

429
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,923
Your grandmother, Claudia,
belongs to the shadow.

430
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,286
Never trust her.

431
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,286
No matter what she says.

432
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,375
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

433
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:05,381
Jonas trusted her before
and he will trust her again.

434
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,705
Jonas thinks he will change everything...

435
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:11,081
but he's just her puppet.

436
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,831
He doesn't deserve any better.

437
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,543
Time is an infinite field.

438
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,463
Millions and millions
of interlocking wheels.

439
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,415
We have to be patient to be victorious.

440
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,630
But our time will come.

441
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,673
We will free humanity from its immaturity.

442
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,251
From its pain.

443
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,041
But you must be strong.

444
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,325
Can you do that?

445
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:02,288
Yes.

446
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,456
It's time.

447
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,665
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

448
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,326
One, two...

449
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,793
One, two, three.

450
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,543
Hey, you. Hands up!

451
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,080
On the ground!

452
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,036
Who are you?

453
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,003
Where am I?

454
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,423
What year is this?

455
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,923
Welcome to the future.

456
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:37,916
