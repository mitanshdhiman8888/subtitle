<i>If we knew</i>

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,325
<i>how things would end...</i>

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,960
<i>where our journey would take us...</i>

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:37,455
<i>would we still make the same decisions?</i>

6
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,915
<i>Or would we choose a different path?</i>

7
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,626
<i>Could we even escape our fate?</i>

8
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,998
<i>Or would what is deep within us</i>

9
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,536
<i>lead us to the same end,</i>

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,080
<i>like an invisible hand?</i>

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,460
<i>Does it matter which path we choose</i>

12
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,536
<i>if we end up</i>

13
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,708
<i>facing ourselves again and again?</i>

14
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,883
Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...

15
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,168
-I don't understand.
-We don't have time.

16
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,083
What time are you from?

17
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,880
The question isn't from what time,

18
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,503
but from what world.

19
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,791
How did we get here?

20
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,788
I asked how we got here!

21
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,921
You're not Martha.

22
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,575
Who are you?

23
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,670
Today's the day it all began.

24
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,248
The day we first met.

25
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,501
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,325
That you and I...

27
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,665
your world and my world...

28
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,576
form a knot
that is inextricably intertwined.

29
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,955
Your world?

30
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,285
What do you mean, your world?

31
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,208
I'll make it right.

32
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,418
-I promise.
-Wait! Where are you going?

33
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,250
Why am I here?

NOVEMBER 4, 2019

35
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,455
Mikkel, put that away.

36
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,956
-Morning.
-No wonder you can't sleep at night.

37
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,250
What's up with him?

38
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,248
The same nightmare he always has.

39
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,251
Mikkel, that's enough.

40
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,245
Maybe it wasn't a dream.

41
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,171
But the here and now is one.
And none of us are real.

42
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
Ever thought about that?

43
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,543
Ha-ha! Very funny.

44
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,745
Oh, the damn electricity!

45
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,288
Pass the butter.

46
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,205
Come on, Mikkel. Go get ready now.

47
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,326
The bowl!

48
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,996
Is Magnus up yet?

49
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,498
-Martha, is Magnus up yet?
-No idea.

50
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,330
-Are you nuts?
-I just wanted to see if you were real.

51
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,826
Magnus!

52
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,785
Magnus!

53
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,285
You're going to be late!

54
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,631
Hello!

55
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,576
Magnus, either you get down here
or I'm coming up!

56
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll be down in a sec.

57
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,421
-Asshole!
-Race you to school. Morning, Mom.

58
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,830
-Idiot.
-Morning.

59
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,035
Shall I give you a ride?

60
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,463
It's supposed to rain later.

61
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,418
No, I'll be home late today.
Play rehearsal.

62
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,290
Don't forget, starting tomorrow
you guys are at your father's place.

63
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,500
Man, Mom, that sucks.

64
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,043
Good morning, sleepy head.

65
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,881
I was awake half the night again.

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Why did it take so long?

67
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,331
First day back at school.
Long line at the baker's.

68
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,460
The apocalypse is coming.

69
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Stay awhile.

70
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,205
I'm running late.

71
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,626
I'll see you this evening, okay?

72
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
Ulrich?

73
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,883
I love you.

74
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,131

78
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,875
Welcome back to hell.

79
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,878
Just because you're too pea-brained to see
education is the only way out of this dump

80
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,538
doesn't mean we all share
your retarded opinion.

81
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,495
-Don't forget to breathe.
-Don't forget to think.

82
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,290
-Hey.
-Hey.

83
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,955
-Have you seen Kilian?
-Nope.

84
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,671
Why all the effort?

85
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,290
We all die in the end.

86
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,376
Are you sure you're not adopted?

87
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,498
Are you sure you don't have a stick
up your ass that needs surgical removal?

88
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,213
-Dumbass!
-Dumbass yourself!

89
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,331
-Hey, Martha.
-Kilian.

90
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,918
Is there any news about Erik?

91
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,746
No.

92
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,461
It's all pretty creepy.

93
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,915

<i>We request all grades to gather in the gym</i>
<i>for first-period assembly.</i>

95
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,041
It'll be about your brother.

96
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,380
It's been two weeks already.
He's never been away this long.

97
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,080
He'd always send me a message

98
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,206
whenever he couldn't stand it
at home anymore.

99
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,921
But this time, nothing.

100
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,423

He hasn't said anything else all morning.

-It will happen again.
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

Fine. Just a check-up.

<i>Erik Obendorf</i>
<i>has been missing since October 22.</i>

125
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,288
That's almost two weeks now.
No traces, no witnesses.

126
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:49,075
Questioning the neighbors didn't bring
any new evidence to light either.

127
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,708
So, do you have any ideas?

128
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,916
We still haven't got the shift schedules
from the nuclear power plant.

129
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,498
All right, then follow up on that.
Go see Tiedemann.

130
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,423
-Wöller, look into the tire treads.
-Yes.

131
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,670
-Jankowski, talk to the Obendorfs again.
-Okay.

132
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,500
Maybe he just took off.

133
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,285
It wouldn't be the first time.

134
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,963
<i>Well, a black hole...</i>

135
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,750
<i>forms when a central region collapses in</i>
<i>upon itself.</i>

136
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,826
{\an8}And it contains neutrons.

137
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,746
{\an8}WORMHOLE

138
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,133
Well, more like neutron matter.

139
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,078
But not enough of it.

140
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,956
So when the light of a star
three times the mass of the sun goes out,

141
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,418
then it explodes.

142
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,415
No, it implodes.

143
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,628
And that is a black hole.

144
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,333
And...

145
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,290
Can I help you?

146
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,423
Hello?

147
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,876
Are you new?

148
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
I'm Jonas.

149
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,125
Are you sure this is your class?

150
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
I wasn't notified of any new students.

151
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,630
A signature was missing.

152
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,251
Okay.

153
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
Bartosz, please continue.

154
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,291
Mm-hmm.

155
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,170
So then we have a black hole.

156
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,786
And it has a huge gravitational pull.

157
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,881
Everything flying around the hole
is drawn to it and somehow dragged inside.

158
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,291
Other stars, planets, and even light.

159
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:50,376
The gravitational force is so strong,
that even light is pulled into it.

160
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,423
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

161
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,211
Basically, no one knows what's behind it.

162
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,711
Maybe nothing. Or maybe a new world.

163
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,831
A world in which nothing is
as it is in ours.

164
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,706
All I'm asking is to review
your employees' shift schedules.

165
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,381
Erik was last seen on the forest road.

166
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,418
The schedules

167
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,290
will allow us to check employee vehicles
with the tire treads we found.

168
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,918
Do you have a court order?

169
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,375
This is a request.

170
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,081
Not an order.

171
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,788
I'll have someone search them out.

172
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,625
How are you?

173
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,751
Holding up.

174
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,543
Okay, then.

175
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,248
I was wondering...

176
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,165
Do you think Erik could have made his way
onto the grounds?

177
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,211
The caves are partly located
under the nuclear power plant.

178
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,923
That's impossible.

179
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,746
The access points
were sealed up years ago.

180
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,211
No one can get in that way.

181
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,706
Okay, then.

182
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,376
<i>A quick reminder</i>
<i>that all afternoon activities</i>

183
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,708
<i>after four o'clock are canceled</i>
<i>due to the parents' meeting.</i>

184
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,041
<i>Except theater,</i>
<i>which will go on as planned</i>

185
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,455
<i>but vacate the auditorium an hour earlier.</i>

186
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,541
<i>The school newspaper</i>
<i>will meet in the youth café today</i>

187
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,495
<i>under the supervision of Mr. Hopf.</i>

188
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,746
Katharina.

189
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,960
What are you doing here?

190
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,126
-I wanted to see you.
-Uh-huh.

191
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,535
I don't know...

192
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,291
I know you and Ulrich...

193
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,746
Ulrich and the kids...
I know they're part of him.

194
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,211
And I want you to know
I won't stand in the way of that.

195
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,495
That's very generous of you.

196
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,495
Did Ulrich stop
at your place this morning?

197
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,920
He wanted to bring something by.

198
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,630
Bring what by?

199
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,131
I don't know.

200
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,576
Something for school. For the kids.

201
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,421
No.

202
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,671
Then maybe he forgot.

203
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,956
Please don't forget to turn in
your presentations next week.

204
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,673
No exceptions!

205
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,918
Something up?

206
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,415
You didn't tell me why I'm here.

207
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,420
Do we know each other?

208
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,043
You have no idea who I am.

209
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:14,786
You coming?

210
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,326
ARIADNE
A PLAY

211
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,166
Jonas, right?

212
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,630
Everything okay?

213
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,633
What day is it today?

214
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,081
November 4.

215
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,080
What year?

216
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,418
2019.

217
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,750
I don't understand...

218
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,713
Mom?

219
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,746
Pardon?

220
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,456
Are you okay?

221
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,495
Can I help you?

222
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,748
POLICE

223
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,793
Charlotte?

224
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,456
We have to stop this.

225
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,543
That's not what
you were saying this morning.

226
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,333
Ulrich, not here.

227
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,375
Oh... I'm sorry.

228
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,288
What is it?

229
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,581
Um... the...

230
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,076
The tire treads.

231
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,126
Forty-seven cars and two trucks.

232
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,455
In Winden alone
there are 21,000 registered vehicles.

233
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,921
Yes. What do you want me to do with that?

234
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,171
I...

235
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,423
No idea.

236
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,380
I got the power plant shift schedules.
We can run a check.

237
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,035
Wöller.

238
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,785
<i>From then on, I knew that nothing changes.</i>

239
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,495
<i>That all things remain.</i>

240
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,750
The spinning wheel turns.

241
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,213
Round and round, in a circle.

242
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,541
One fate tied to the next.

243
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,541
A thread,

244
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,671
red like blood,

245
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,080
that connects all our deeds.

246
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,998
One cannot unravel the knots.

247
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,208
But they can be severed.

248
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,378
He severed ours

249
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,288
with the sharpest blade.

250
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,128
And yet, something remains behind
that cannot be severed.

251
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,378
An invisible bond.

252
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,750
On many a night, he tugs at it.

253
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:05,213
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

254
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,833
That all remains.

255
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,168
And because
their eyes and hearts were blind,

256
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,378
they were punished for their sins.
Here and now.

257
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,418
And what flew plummeted to Earth.

258
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,880
And what was on Earth changed its shape.

259
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,038
Revealed its grotesque face,

260
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,035
which was nothing
but blasphemy made flesh.

261
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,421
Great. We'll stop here.

262
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,076
Unfortunately,
we have to finish early today.

263
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,543
Please put everything away
for the parents' meeting tonight. Thanks.

264
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,078
Nine o'clock tonight by the bridge.
Don't forget.

265
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,581
Martha.

266
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,921
I have no idea what you want from me,
but I want nothing from you, okay?

267
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,790
So get lost.

268
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,918
Please listen to me.
Maybe you don't know who I am.

269
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,750
-But today is November 4, and Mikkel--
-What? Mikkel?

270
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,205
Michael Kahnwald, Hannah's husband.
He's not who you think--

271
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,961
Hannah's husband? Are you joking?

272
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,955
I don't know any Michael Kahnwald.

273
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,130
Hannah's husband is my dad
and his name is Ulrich.

274
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,671
I don't know what your deal is,
but just fuck off already, okay?

275
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,961
Wait. Not so fast.

276
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,538
I...

277
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,460
love you.

278
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,830
I love you.

279
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,916
It will happen again.

280
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
It will...

281
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,381
happen again.

282
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,376
It will happen again.

283
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,170
Mom?

284
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,751
Dad?

285
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,673
It will happen again.

286
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,538
It will...

287
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,328
happen again.

288
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,670
Tick, tock.

289
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,288
Tick, tock.

290
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,665
-Grandpa, is everything okay?
-Tick, tock.

291
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,293
Tick, tock.

292
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,498
The beginning is the end.

293
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,753
And the end is the beginning.

294
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,541
Tick, tock.

295
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,580
Tick, tock.

296
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:32,328
REGINA TIEDEMANN
AUGUST 1, 1971 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2019

297
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,165
Can I help you?

298
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,963
Are you looking for
something in particular?

299
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,418
I wanted to know
if someone was buried here.

300
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,038
Who?

301
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,631
Kahnwald,

302
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,083
Michael Kahnwald.

303
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,125
No, we have a Daniel Kahnwald,
died in '64,

304
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,461
but no Michael Kahnwald.

305
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,168
Maybe that's why I'm here.

306
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,998
So that it doesn't happen.

307
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,745
What happens?

308
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,631
Do I know you?

309
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,628
I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

310
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,626
Hey, wait!

311
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,291
What's your name?

312
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:20,286
SEPTEMBER 21, 1987

313
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,423
Hello?

314
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:49,168
Can I help you? You must be lost.

315
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,208
The master key.

316
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,923
For the nuclear power plant.

317
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,500
Is this a joke?

318
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,673
You kept it.

319
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,828
Do you think this is funny?

320
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,423
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

321
00:38:59,166 --> 00:38:59,996
<i>Police--</i>

322
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,751
What do you want from me?

323
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,043
Nothing is in vain.

324
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,333
No breath.

325
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,750
No step.

326
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,075
No word.

327
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
No pain.

328
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,790
An everlasting miracle...

329
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,785
of the One.

330
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,168
Who the hell are you?

331
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,038
The police were here today.

332
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,713
You know what you've got to do.

333
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:02,956
Kilian?

334
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,963
Stop screwing around, okay?

335
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,245
What is this?

336
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:26,996
What do you want here?

337
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,325
I don't want to scare you.

338
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,543
-Why did you say we know each other?
-We do know each other.

339
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,000
Not now, but in another time.

340
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,631
What does that mean?

341
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,626
You've seen all this before.

342
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,673
The light.

343
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,000
The forest. Me.

344
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,746
It's déjà vu.

345
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,035
Or a glitch in the matrix.

346
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,288
What?

347
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,455
I think I know why I'm here now.

348
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,498
Why you came to get me.

349
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,285
So that I change it.

350
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,170
Change what?

351
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,168
Who is he?

352
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,830
-Where's Mikkel?
-Mikkel?

353
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,955
Mikkel isn't with you?

354
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,503
Are you blind or what?

355
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,125
What's he doing here?

356
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,793
Did you bring him along?

357
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,291
What is this?

358
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,793
-How do you know my brother?
-This can't be.

359
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:04,125
You took him with you.
Heide, the babysitter, is sick.

360
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,078
And he didn't want to stay home alone,
so he came along.

361
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,540
No idea what the fuck this is,

362
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,288
but Mikkel is old enough
to look after himself.

363
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,671
Now, you'd better fuck off.

364
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:18,995
Get lost, freak.

365
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,288
Come on.

366
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,673
Martha.

367
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,920
POLICE

368
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,746
Charlotte?
I'm going to the parents' meeting.

369
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,003
I can give you a ride if you like.

370
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,538
All right.

371
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,830
-Will you carry on with this?
-Mm-hmm.

372
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,883
Why did he act like he knew you?

373
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,625
-Do you know him?
-No.

374
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,126
Who knows.

375
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,040
Did you know Nostradamus predicted
the world would end this year?

376
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,080
What a load of crap.

377
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,920
No. Really.

378
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,575
The apocalypse
is practically around the corner.

379
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,790
Glad I got myself a girlfriend
with her own bunker.

380
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,133
What?

381
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:24,705
Nothing.

382
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:25,923
Ow!

383
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,040
What?

384
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,418
And you think you'll find something here?

385
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,035
Erik sometimes spent nights here
in summer.

386
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,415
Maybe the police overlooked something.

387
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,540
Have you heard the story
of the cave monster?

388
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,705
-Spare us the bullshit, man.
-It's not bullshit.

389
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,211
Some 100 years ago,

390
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,501
just after World War I,
they did experiments in there.

391
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,083
What kind of experiments?

392
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,330
-What was that?
-What?

393
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,460
Shit.

394
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,293
What's in the cave?

395
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,575
-What is it?
-Oh, shit!

396
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,418
-Fuck!
-What is that?

397
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,495
-Fuck! What's going on?
-Go! Run!

398
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,213
-What's with the flashlights?
-Go!

399
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,630
-Out of here! Out of here!
-Martha!

400
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,168
-Martha, come on.
-Out of here!

401
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,380
Run! Run!

402
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,001
Kilian?

403
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:22,538
Kilian?

404
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,415
Martha.

405
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,576
-Is it over?
-I think so.

406
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,921
What...

407
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,165
What... What is that?

408
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,790
Oh, God!

409
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,463
Fuck!

410
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,130
Shit!

411
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,246
Oh, shit. Shit!

412
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,583
Fuck.

413
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,541
-Is he dead?
-Fuck.

414
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,630
Yes, I think so.

415
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,378
Who... Who is that?

416
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,170
STUDENT CARD
MADS NIELSEN, DECEMBER 4, 1973

417
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,378
Mads Nielsen.

418
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,286
I've waited for this moment for so long.

419
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,581
For you to come back.

420
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,213
Who are you?

421
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,631
Mikkel.

422
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,710
He didn't travel back.

423
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,670
He won't become your father.

424
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,580
And you...

425
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,665
will never be born in this world.

426
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:31,416
A world without you.

427
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,915
Isn't that what you wanted?

428
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:39,576
Yet, despite that,

429
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,415
this world is doomed
to the same fate as yours.

430
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,126
Everything will fall apart.

431
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,575
In this world, just as it will in yours.

432
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:54,245
Again.

433
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,670
And again.

434
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:58,788
Because of you.

435
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,205
And because of me.

436
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,880
Martha.

437
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:50,003
SEPTEMBER 21, 1888

438
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:27,963
Jonas?

439
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,878
You're alive.

440
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,625
You're alive!

441
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,915
I'm not Martha.

442
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:45,746
Not your Martha.

443
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,250
What does that mean?

444
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,461
I'm here to help you find the origin.

445
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,130
The one thing...

446
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,673
that's the beginning of everything.

447
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,458
In your world...

448
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,380
and in mine.

449
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:17,208
