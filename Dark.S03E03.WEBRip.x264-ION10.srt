1
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,705
"From then on,
I knew that nothing changes.

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,130
That all things remain.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
The spinning wheel turns,

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,793
round and round, in a circle.

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,285
One fate tied to the next.

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,631
A thread, red like blood,

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,078
that connects all our deeds."

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,791
That was your mother's favorite play.

9
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,998
She surely would have liked
to come with us tonight,

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,293
in the company
of such a distinguished young man.

11
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,746
FOR CHARLOTTE

12
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,133
Why do we die?

13
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,575
The dead are never truly dead.

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,706
Maybe they're not here, now.

15
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,961
But everything that once lived,

16
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,541
lives on forever.

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,633
In the eternity of time.

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,963
You there, what are you doing on the road?

19
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,173
I asked what you're doing!

20
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,171
Who is there?

21
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,706
Who are you?

22
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,418
He who has eyes to see

23
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,583
and ears to hear

24
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,458
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret,

25
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,673
because if his lips are silent,

26
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,036
he chatters with his fingertips.

27
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,381
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,630
I...

29
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,670
I... I don't understand.

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,380
Oh, but you do.

31
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,961
You're going into town
to draft a telegram.

32
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,958
Because you want
to tell the world about us.

33
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,748
Are you not?

34
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,536
You're one of them.

35
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,708
A traveler.

36
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,915
All those years

37
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,041
they said my father was insane.

38
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,955
But now they are here.

39
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,785
The travelers from the future.

40
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,456
The world must know

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
that they exist.

42
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,415
What we know...

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,960
is a drop.

44
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,713
What we don't know...

45
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,668
is an ocean.

46
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,920
ADAM AND EVA

47
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,745
The mistake in all of our thinking is...

48
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,128
that we each believe ourselves

49
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,918
to be an independent entity.

50
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,963
One self...

51
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,326
beside countless other selves.

52
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,171
While in reality, we're all just fractions

53
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,580
of an infinite whole.

54
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,916
What is this place?

55
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,496
A copy of my world?

56
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,918
Do you remember what you said to me?

57
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,001
Under the bridge.

58
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,080
The light.

59
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,996
The forest.

60
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,748
You.

61
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,535
Me.

62
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,711
A glitch in the matrix.

63
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,498
Why am I here?

64
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,285
You and I.

65
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,881
Adam and Eva.

66
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,423
That's what we are.

67
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,501
A glitch in the matrix.

68
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,003
You want to know why you're here?

69
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,206
To save them.

70
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,878
Your world.

71
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,080
And mine.

72
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,381
POLICE

73
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,038
Last night at around 10:00 p.m.,

74
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,625
Kilian Obendorf,

75
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,038
Bartosz Tiedemann, and Franziska Doppler,

76
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,875
along with Magnus and Martha Nielsen,

77
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,538
found an as-yet-unidentified boy's body

78
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,165
on the Doppler property,
by the forest road.

79
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,668
His clothes

80
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,880
and the Walkman are from the 1980s.

81
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,495
We also found...

82
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,496
an ID card on the body.

83
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,581
Wöller, can you continue?

84
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,246
Can I talk to you for a second?

85
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,001
You don't have to do this.

86
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,170
Wöller can do the briefings.
I can go to forensics.

87
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,580
Go home.

88
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,463
I've spent 33 years
looking for my brother.

89
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,455
Those are his belongings.

90
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,786
Those are Mads' belongings.

91
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,173
Someone...

92
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,668
kept them all.

93
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,035
And then put them on the boy
in the bunker.

94
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,708
Thirty-three years later.

95
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,456
You think it was the same killer?

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,920
That it's all connected?

97
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,745
Mads, Erik, the boy in the bunker?

98
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,920
Do you know why I joined the police?

99
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,631
When my brother disappeared...

100
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,788
they made pretty much every mistake
you could imagine.

101
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,920
The detective was a drunken moron.

102
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,785
And me?

103
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,666
I swore I'd do it all differently.

104
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,081
That I'd do everything right.

105
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,540
That was 33 years ago.

106
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,166
And what do I do?

107
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,330
My marriage is ruined.

108
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,251
And now I'm cheating on the woman
I cheated on my wife with.

109
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,878
I can't do this anymore.

110
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:18,376
TANNHAUS
MACHINERY FACTORY

111
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,500
Where were you?

112
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,328
What did she tell you?

113
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,711
We've been stuck here for weeks.

114
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,711
The fucking device is empty.

115
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,961
You have no idea
how any of this shit works.

116
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,421
All you did was lie.

117
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,170
You knew what would happen,
and you told us nothing!

118
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Don't you realize she's just using you?

119
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,293
That isn't Martha.

120
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,081
She's dead.

121
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,166
No one returns from the dead.

122
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,495
Whoever she is...

123
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,576
she may be our only chance
to get out of here.

124
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,328
Why don't you tell us the truth?

125
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,503
Tell them

126
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,673
who really killed Martha.

127
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,920
Bartosz! Wait!

128
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,075
Tell them!

129
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,998
Tell them who Adam really is!

130
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,375
I told you all along!

131
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,076
Jonas is to blame for everything.

132
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,130
It's him.

133
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,750
He's Adam!

134
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,383
He's Adam!

135
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,041
In all of that, didn't you ever wonder

136
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,455
why you can't let go of her?

137
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,576
You know you two are impossible.

138
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,003
Yet still...

139
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,170
you can't let her go.

140
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,205
An invisible bond

141
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,503
that binds you for eternity.

142
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,418
Adam tried to sever it.

143
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,673
But that's impossible.

144
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,171
You gave this to me.

145
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,461
You and I.

146
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,043
Black and white.

147
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,881
Light and shadow.

148
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,625
We are bound together for eternity

149
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,921
in this eternally repeating

150
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,673
déjà vu.

151
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,785
What is all this?

152
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,291
What do you want?

153
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,463
Why don't you just tell me
why I'm really here?

154
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,498
You've seen what you'll do.

155
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,210
What Adam will do.

156
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,128
If you want to save your Martha,

157
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,785
you have to choose the side of light.

158
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,423
And you have to make me what I am today.

159
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,630
I have to?

160
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,168
I don't want to have
to do anything anymore.

161
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,915
I'm sick to death
of always having to do things!

162
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,206
Then ask yourself

163
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,331
what you want.

164
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,751
Do you want her to live?

165
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,043
Your Martha?

166
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,535
Dad?

167
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,126
Can I come in?

168
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Is Magnus here too?

169
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,536
I think he's still sleeping.

170
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,785
You have to tell me the truth.

171
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,705
What really happened in the bunker?

172
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,671
What did you see?

173
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,995
I did tell the truth.

174
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,248
We went in and the bunker was empty.

175
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,291
There was nobody there.

176
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,423
Then there was a light.

177
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,253
And then this...

178
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,503
this body fell down.

179
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,083
Had you taken anything?

180
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,501
What?

181
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,001
Did that Kilian kid give you anything?

182
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,211
Come on, what did you take?

183
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,328
What is this shit?

184
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,958
Are you playing the worried father now?

185
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,960
You usually don't give a shit about us!

186
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,791
It's just as we told you.

187
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,205
There was this noise...

188
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,381
It came from the caves
or the ground, or... I don't know.

189
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,828
We went into the bunker.
At first there was nothing there, then...

190
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,750
he was lying there.

191
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,333
Is that all?

192
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,001
Mom will be back any moment.
You'd better go.

193
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,036
But it was nice of you to drop by
to see how we're doing.

194
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,535
-Hannah.
-Hello.

195
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:41,285
Is Ulrich here?
I was trying to reach him all morning.

196
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,078
I thought he went home.

197
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,541
You look so different.

198
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,875
Did you get a haircut?

199
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,375
No.

200
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,711
It's nice to see you.

201
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,580
I'll just put this in his office.

202
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,830
Can we talk?

203
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,173
Get lost.

204
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,423
Last night...

205
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,625
in the forest...

206
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,576
Did you see anything else?

207
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
No.

208
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,463
Like what?

209
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,076
Do you sometimes feel
like you're losing your mind?

210
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,825
That nothing makes sense anymore?

211
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,748
Maybe...

212
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,963
Dad is right.

213
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,745
Maybe he was already lying there.

214
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,131
And we...

215
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,916
I know what I saw.

216
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,375
Where are you going?

217
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,035
Don't tell Mom.

218
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,745
I'll be back for dinner.

219
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,210
<i>Everything repeats itself,</i>

220
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,381
<i>again and again.</i>

221
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,290
<i>For all eternity.</i>

222
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,330
Because none of us is prepared to let go.

223
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,253
It took me a long time

224
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,330
to understand that.

225
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,753
That you can't let go of your past.

226
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,670
That you will always choose her,

227
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,206
always choose your Martha.

228
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,583
And just as you can't let go of your past,

229
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,826
I've spent my life clinging to mine.

230
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,381
You trusted Adam.

231
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,915
But where did that lead you?

232
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,578
You have to show her

233
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,035
how everything is connected.

234
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,578
You don't have much time left.

235
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,833
She has to see her future
in order to understand

236
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,706
what must be done.

237
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,706
She will follow you.

238
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,828
She is bound to your fate,

239
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,785
just as you are to hers.

240
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,003
You said I was in your world.

241
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,916
With you.

242
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,751
Why can't I remember it?

243
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,380
I don't know.

244
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,673
That letter...

245
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,246
I didn't write it.

246
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,130
You have to believe me.

247
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,291
Sic Mundus...

248
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,713
What is it?

249
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,460
Old Tannhaus' father...

250
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,131
tried to bring someone back from the dead.

251
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,498
His wife.

252
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,825
He was convinced
that the ability to time-travel

253
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,786
would be the world's salvation.

254
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,830
Every mistake could be prevented
before it even occurs.

255
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,166
But it doesn't bring salvation.

256
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,711
Only damnation.

257
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,333
They're all dead.

258
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,500
In my world.

259
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,330
I can't help hoping I can change that.

260
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,876
I know you think you can't trust me.

261
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,381
I want to prove to you that you can.

262
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,378
You traveled with that?

263
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,168
This is the last one I have.

264
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,880
It's the only way I can go back again.

265
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,330
You could have told him
which path you're sending him down.

266
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,246
How it will end.

267
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,788
He will never stop trying
to break this cycle.

268
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,625
He'll never understand

269
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
that we must preserve the knot.

270
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,955
That his Martha must die.

271
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,418
So all the others can live.

272
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,918
The beginning...

273
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,876
and the end.

274
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,788
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
VOLUME CONTROL SYSTEM

275
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,043
Ulrich, it's Charlotte. I...

276
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,205
I just wanted to know how you're doing.

277
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,878
Call me, okay?

278
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,038
Tick...

279
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,828
tock.

280
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,208
Tick...

281
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,830
tock.

282
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,576
I'm here to see Kilian.

283
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,375
Kilian.

284
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,125
Hey.

285
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,418
Hey.

286
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,206
It's okay.

287
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,128
What are you doing here?

288
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,328
You weren't at the dorm. I was worried.

289
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,251
They kicked me out.

290
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,420
Your father called.

291
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,670
He wanted to know
if I slipped you guys something.

292
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,130
-Did you?
-Fuck no! No, I didn't.

293
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:31,878
But sure, none of you
can get it out of your system.

294
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,670
I haven't lived here for two years,

295
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,540
but I'm still the trailer park trash
everyone points the finger at.

296
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,245
I knew it.

297
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,416
What did you know?

298
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,583
That you were only with me
to rile up your parents.

299
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,578
You don't give a crap about me or Erik.

300
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,668
You'd better go.

301
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:05,961
Okay.

302
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,583
Okay.

303
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,458
About Regina...

304
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,633
I'm sorry.

305
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,746
It must be difficult for you.

306
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,210
How are you?

307
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:55,828
Bartosz?

308
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,253
We're managing.

309
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:04,916
I...

310
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,075
I'd like to propose a deal.

311
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,833
A deal?

312
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,918
I have something that belongs to you.

313
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,285
I'd like to return it.

314
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,998
Do you recognize it?

315
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,673
Don't worry.
The contents are in a safe place.

316
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,075
What do you want? Do you want money?

317
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,998
I don't want money.

318
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,671
I want you to destroy Charlotte.

319
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,668
I want her to lose everything.

320
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:11,921
Everything.

321
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,826
Charlotte!

322
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,125
What are you doing here?

323
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,041
Thanks.

324
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,036
You've helped me very much.

325
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,998
I tried to get a hold of you.

326
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:17,171
I went to the bunker.
Why aren't you home with Franziska?

327
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,461
I...

328
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,381
Last night, where was Helge?

329
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,923
You said you ate dinner with him.
Where was he afterwards?

330
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,290
What is this?

331
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,495
In 1987, when you came to Winden,
did your father still live in the cabin?

332
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,125
-I don't understand.
-Did he or didn't he?

333
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:50,788
No. After the accident
he moved into the nursing home.

334
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:54,075
-And the summer before, in '86?
-I think so. Why do you want to know?

335
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,996
Did he use the bunker for anything?

336
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,383
Charlotte, what do you want from me?

337
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,536
This is Helge's.

338
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,075
I found it in the bunker.

339
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,583
That... That can't be.
He was with us all night.

340
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,290
Doppler here.

341
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,416
He did what?

342
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:33,996
Where?

343
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,285
Yes.

344
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,915
Yes, I'll be right there.

345
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:41,923
Helge.

346
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,165
He's at the police station.

347
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:49,456
He made a confession.

348
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,791
POLICE

349
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,665
Dad, why are you saying this?

350
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,001
It makes no sense at all.

351
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,415
He didn't leave the house.

352
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,540
I was with him all evening.

353
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,165
Elisabeth was there, too.

354
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,460
I killed the boy.

355
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,495
-Dad, cut it out!
-His things...

356
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,078
The Walkman. The clothes.

357
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:23,498
Those are Mads Nielsen's things,
the boy who disappeared in 1986.

358
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,791
Do you remember that?

359
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,668
I killed him.

360
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,460
Who? Mads?

361
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,083
Where did you get his stuff?

362
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,421
What did you do to Mads?

363
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,920
What did you do to him?

364
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,205
You're alive.

365
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,825
-What?
-It was you.

366
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,076
What was me?

367
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,536
It was him.

368
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,995
What? Get off me!

369
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,455
It was him.

370
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,128
-What are you saying?
-It was him!

371
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:03,286
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
1986

372
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:26,501
What is this?

373
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,575
Are you following me?

374
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,038
Why won't you tell me
how we know each other?

375
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,165
Actually, we've always known each other.

376
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,326
When Magnus knocked your tooth out
in kindergarten...

377
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,380
I was there.

378
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,706
When Mikkel put spiders in your shoes
while camping in the yard...

379
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:10,035
On the third grade class trip...

380
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,290
when you were so homesick
that Katharina had to come get you.

381
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,213
Where I come from,

382
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,790
you and I have the same past.

383
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,418
You're nuts.

384
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,998
I know that you saw yourself.

385
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,580
Last night in the forest.

386
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,166
You told me about it.

387
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,000
Your future self did.

388
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,001
What?

389
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,830
I know how completely insane
this all sounds.

390
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,916
For the longest time
I too thought it was all totally crazy.

391
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,500
That I was crazy.

392
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,128
Who are you really?

393
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,630
I can show you.

394
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,963
How it's all connected.

395
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,750
Where's Martha?

396
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,421
LET THERE BE LIGHT

397
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:28,376
SEPTEMBER 23, 2053

398
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:25,583
So you gave it to him?

399
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,958
I always was too gullible.

400
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,043
You did the right thing.

401
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,168
What is this place?

402
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,461
Where are we?

403
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,080
How did you do that?

404
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:54,248
She told me to bring you here.

405
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,536
That she'd explain it to you.

406
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,496
Who?

407
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,326
Who is that?

408
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,383
Welcome to the future.

409
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,963
