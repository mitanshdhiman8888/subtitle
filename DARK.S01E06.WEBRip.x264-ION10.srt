1
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,961
This isn't funny anymore.

2
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,208
Katharina?

3
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:33,825
Ulrich?

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,630
This isn't funny anymore.

5
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,956
Help!

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,040
Help!

7
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,826
Help!

8
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,961
It was just a nightmare.

9
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,536
Tell me everything's all right.

10
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,375
Everything is all right.

11
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,881
One dead boy...

12
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,788
MISSING

13
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,495
...three missing children.

14
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,793
We're widening the search.
I want you to knock on every door.

15
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:29,286
Start with the residential areas close
to where the children were last seen.

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,125
I want you to question everyone. Everyone.

17
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,498
Someone must have seen something.

18
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,923
Coordinate with other departments
in the district.

19
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,420
I also want you to search the archives

20
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,630
for similar cases in and around Winden
over the last 50 years.

21
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,706
Even if a child went missing
for just 24 hours, I want to know.

22
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,576
I want you all working double shifts.
Leave no stone left unturned in this town.

23
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,038
Search every single basement.

24
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,665
Everyone leaves
some kind of trace somewhere.

25
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,753
We just have to find it.

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,920
How did you and Dad meet?

27
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,541
In the hospital.

28
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,205
I was 14.

29
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,921
Your father had a broken leg.

30
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,876
And I was in a bad mood.

31
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,673
What was he like?

32
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,211
Earlier.

33
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,133
Before he got sick.

34
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,378
He was...

35
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,711
different.

36
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,958
You never knew
if he meant something seriously or not.

37
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,630
Mom...

38
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,496
Yes?

39
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,456
Nothing.

40
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,381

WINDEN BOY (12) VANISHES

42
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,170
MADS NIELSEN MISSING

43
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,541
When does he normally come home?

44
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,631
He goes to fencing classes on Thursdays.

45
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,133
And he gets home just after six.

46
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,575
When he wasn't home by seven,
I knew something was wrong.

47
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,035
And your husband?

48
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,785
Where was he?

49
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,915
He was home. With us, he...

50
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:09,375
The three of us were waiting for Mads.
Tronte, Ulrich and I.

51
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,833
Where are you going?

52
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,576
School.

53
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,541
No, you aren't going anywhere.

54
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,325
Is this supposed to go on forever?

55
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,325
Keeping us locked up here?

56
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,036
Locked up?

57
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,421
Your brother
has only been missing four days.

58
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,750
He's not going to come back
just because we're sitting around.

59
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,003
Come back here and talk to me!

60
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,245
I can't let the others down.
They need me.

61
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,825
Who needs you?

62
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,746
The play...

63
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,456
I thought it was cancelled.

64
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,751
No! Mr. Meinel said it'd be better
to give people a break,

65
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,673
so they can think about something else.

66
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,076
Great.

67
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,211
So everyone
is just thinking of themselves.

68
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,081
You're no different!

69
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,626
Did you once think about us
these last few days?

70
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,128
That's enough!

71
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,956
And how many more of these
damned things will you put up?

72
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,333
-She didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, I did! I meant it like that.

73
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,996
This is so fucked up!

74
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,213
Everyone's waiting for Mikkel to come back
through that door, as if nothing happened.

75
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,041
Dad doesn't even dare
come home anymore!

76
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,631
-And no one gives a shit about us.
-That's not true.

77
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,378
But for once,
this isn't about you, Martha.

78
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,043
You're so blind.

79
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,460
Everyone's thinking it,
but no one dares say it.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mikkel is dead!

81
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,246
Oh, shit.

MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING CENTER

83
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,076
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL!

84
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,833
Ulrich.

85
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,956
How are you all holding up?

86
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,376
Katharina, the children?

87
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,460
Where's Mom?

88
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,671
Sleeping.

89
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,998
She's taking pills.

90
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,626
When Mads disappeared back then,

91
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,288
was there ever a suspect?

92
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,325
Did Egon have anything?

93
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,288
Egon?

94
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,375
Egon was an idiot.

95
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,078
He just wanted to retire,
that was all he wanted.

96
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,456
That dead boy we found in the forest...

97
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,578
He was dressed like in the '80s.

98
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,535
Maybe all this has something
to do with what happened back then.

99
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,125
Maybe it's all happening again.

100
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,958
Maybe it's the same perpetrator.

101
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,040
Where were you
the night Mads disappeared?

102
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,075
Mom said you were home.
But I remember, you weren't.

103
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,325
You weren't there for dinner.

104
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,293
You didn't come home
until late that night.

105
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,576
Mom was staring at the clock
the whole time.

106
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,126
Then at some point...

107
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,250
she started to pray.

108
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,666
Very softly.

109
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,208
And you weren't there.

110
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,461
Where were you?

111
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,036
Do you suspect me now?

112
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,423
I've made a lot of mistakes,

113
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,960
but that you could even
think such a thing...

114
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,003
Where were you five days ago,
when Mikkel disappeared?

115
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,383
He was here.

116
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,995
Where else would he have been?

117
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,173
How you two fought over these figures!

118
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,583
It was Christmas.

119
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,083
1985.

120
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,041
You ended up going at each other
like two boxers.

121
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,416
Mads smashed into the glass table
in the living room.

122
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,460
There was so much blood,
like in a horror movie.

123
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,041
But in the end...

124
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,543
it turned out to be just a small cut.

125
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,995
On his chin.

126
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,423
You both laughed yourselves silly.

127
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,130
That's how you were.

128
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,328
One minute you hated each other's guts,

129
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,286
the next minute you were best friends.

130
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,711
Mom, why did you lie?

131
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,173
Dad wasn't home that evening.

132
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,420
You told Egon back then
that Dad was with us.

133
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,130
I listened to the recording.
So why did you lie?

134
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,753
Did you know
that I wanted to leave your father?

135
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,581
Before it all happened.

136
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,881
He was having an affair.

137
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,753
It wasn't the first one.

138
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,040
And the night Mads disappeared...

139
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,496
he was with her.

140
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,376
While your brother disappeared,
he was sleeping with another woman.

141
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,788
Do you know who she was?

142
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,503
Claudia.

143
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,248
Claudia Tiedemann.

144
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,038
Who was the last person
to see Mads that evening?

145
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,420
It was Regina.

146
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,170
Regina Tiedemann.

147
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,830
Claudia's daughter.

148
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,540
You've reached Aleksander Tiedemann.

149
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,875
Please leave a message after the signal.

150
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,131
Hey.

151
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,631
Hey.

152
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,785
How are you?

153
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Good.

154
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,575
You didn't call me back.

155
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
I was getting worried.

156
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,881
I...

157
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,210
I'm so sorry about everything.

158
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,455
It's all my fault.

159
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,285
I shouldn't have had
that stupid idea with the caves.

160
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:45,996
Hey.

161
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,876
Say something.

162
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,376
Are you angry with me?

163
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,631
No.

164
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,003
Why should I be angry?

165
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,666
I can't do this right now.

166
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,998
Do you want to leave?

167
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,671
I'll run away with you.

168
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,753
Honestly.

169
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,075
The play is about to start.

170
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,210
Have you seen Jonas?

171
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,035
Why?

172
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,793
No reason.
The jerk stood me up yesterday.

173
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,665
But... whatever.

174
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm sure he'll come later.

175
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,455
NO ENTRY!

RECIPIENT MR. ULRICH NIELSEN

178
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,710
Hello?

179
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,248
Ulrich?

180
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,785
What are you doing here?

181
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,333
1986.

182
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,376
The night my brother went missing.

183
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,043
What really happened?

184
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,828
That was over 30 years ago.

185
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,746
You were the last one
to see him that night.

186
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,253
Did you notice
anything unusual that day?

187
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,293
Did he say something?
Something strange? Anything at all?

188
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,538
Did you know they were having an affair?

189
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,828
Your mother and my father.

190
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,578
Mads was the only person I knew
who never said a bad word about anyone.

191
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,628
I've always asked myself,
why him, of all people?

192
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,331
I always thought it should have
happened to you instead of him.

193
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,961
But there's no justice in this world.

194
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,286
And the absurd thing is...

195
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:44,535
had it not been for you and Katharina,
maybe Mads wouldn't have disappeared.

196
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,415
Mads knew I was afraid to walk home alone
because of you two.

197
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Because of what you did to me.

198
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,673
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone with me
and returned through the forest.

199
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,460
And the whole thing
would have never happened.

200
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,671
What happened in the forest back then...

201
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,165
It was a game. We were children.
We all made mistakes back then.

202
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,380
And still you never apologized for it.

203
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,630
So this is about an apology for you?

204
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:12,248
So that's how you see yourself.
A victim. Poor, innocent Regina.

205
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,746
You're so fake it makes me sick!

206
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,455
You told your drunken, good-for-nothing
grandpa that I raped Katharina.

207
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,126
That's what you thought?

208
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,706
Hannah saw you back then.

209
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,880
At the police station.

210
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,791
Hannah?

211
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,036
The same Hannah
who at 14 was so in love with you

212
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,455
that she would have done anything
to have you?

213
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,883
But I guess
that hasn't really changed.

214
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:51,036
So that's what you thought
all these years? That I spread that story?

215
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,961
Why would I do something like that?

216
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,956
I'm not half as bad as you are.

217
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:16,463
MISSING

218
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,670
Winden police confirmed yesterday
that the body of a child has been found.

219
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,330
It is not the body of one
of the three children currently missing.

220
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:30,081
Have the police failed us?
Are our children safe?

221
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,626
We'd like to hear from you about this.

222
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:37,418
The number of our hotline
is 0800 64 82 64 82.

223
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:43,325
Get the latest news on our website
and use a special discussion forum...

224
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,746
My name is Katharina Nielsen.

225
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,630
I'm the mother of Mikkel Nielsen,
one of the children...

226
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,630
That's right.

227
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,498
Okay, I'll wait.

228
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,416
We have someone on the line now.

229
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,000
Mrs. Nielsen, mother
of one of Winden's missing children.

230
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,293
She'd like to talk with us about
the tragic events of the last few days.

231
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,325
Mrs. Nielsen?

232
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:10,496
I want people to finally understand
what's really going on here.

233
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,455
We're all so blind.

234
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,168
There's a murderer among us.

235
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,285
No one actually dares to say it.

236
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,875
But it's the truth.

237
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,830
We cling to the hope
that it won't happen here.

238
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,078
We all know one another.

239
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,125
MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING CENTER

240
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,248
We think we know
everything about each other.

241
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,673
But do we really?

242
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,673
We live right next door to people
we know almost nothing about.

243
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,580
RAPE CASE SUSPECT: ULRICH NIELSEN
WITNESS: HANNAH KRÜGER

244
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,666
And behind one of those doors...

245
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,325
is my son.

246
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,498
It could be anyone's door.

247
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,745
The man behind the cash register.

248
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:04,133
Someone we invited for cake on a Sunday,
who plays with our children.

249
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,133
I don't want to look away anymore.

250
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,498
And you shouldn't either.

251
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,205
This city is sick.

252
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,421
Winden is like a festering wound.

253
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,420
And we're all part of it.

254
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,915
Mammography Center.

255
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,921
Hello. Tiedemann speaking.

256
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:44,251
My wife had a cancer examination
at your center on October 27th.

257
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,205
We still don't have the results.

258
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,751
What was her name again?

259
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,793
Tiedemann. Regina Tiedemann.

260
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:56,251
That's odd. The results were sent out
the day before yesterday.

261
00:26:56,333 --> 00:27:00,333
We detected invasive carcinomas
a few weeks ago.

262
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,206
The latest results
show that they have metastasized.

263
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:07,291
Your wife should make an appointment
to see Dr. Urman as soon as possible.

264
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,211
Hello?

265
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,498
Mr. Tiedemann?

266
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,038
Ulrich!

267
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,416
-What are you doing here, I thought...
-What do you want from me?

268
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,503
-What?
-What do you want from me?

269
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,955
It was you in 1986.

270
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,171
You gave a statement against me
in the rape case.

271
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,920
How sick are you?

272
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,831
You're hurting me!

273
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,495
Are you trying to ruin me?

274
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,495
Do you want to destroy my family?
Is that what you want?

275
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,253
What do you want?

276
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,423
You.

277
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,206
You know what? You're poison.

278
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,421
You snuggle up close, like you're honey.
But it's just poison.

279
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,581
How did your husband
put up with you for so long?

280
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:16,246
No wonder
he couldn't take it anymore, in the end.

281
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,705
I thought I knew you.

282
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,665
How easily one can be deceived by people.

283
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:45,455
Now you have heard her,
the daughter of Minos.

284
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,253
You think you know her.

285
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,463
Is she not beautiful and good?

286
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,665
You have let yourself be enchanted.

287
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,883
By her words.

288
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,580
By her pretty gaze.

289
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,380
But believe me.

290
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,498
Everyone,
whether the daughter of a king or not,

291
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,883
has one foot in the shadow

292
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,791
and only the other in the light.

293
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,751
Only 19 minutes to go till 9:17.

294
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,208
What is it?

295
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,038
When are you coming home?

296
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,500
Soon.
I'm just picking up Bartosz from school.

297
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,833
He insisted on going to this play.

298
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,543
I'm here for you. You know that.

299
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,786
No matter what.

300
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,455
Don't be late.

301
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,673
Okay.

302
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:14,211
Regina...

303
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,208
I love you.

304
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,416
I love you too.

305
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,288
Take this.

306
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,125
It will guide you.

307
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:33,998
You have to go deep inside, to the center.
He is waiting there in the shadows.

308
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,503
Half human, half beast.

309
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,128
You must be quick.
Aim straight for the heart.

310
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,495
But is he not your brother?

311
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,496
It is all the same to me.

312
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,878
This bond we tie now,

313
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,128
promise me you will never sever it.

314
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,630
I promise.

315
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:25,541
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL!

316
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,706
Nothing but darkness surrounds me.

317
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,246
Eternally lurking shadows.

318
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,331
I have not eaten in days.

319
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,381
My eyes are turning black.

320
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:43,825
The end is nearing.

321
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,036
Just as he once descended into the maze,

322
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,210
I now descend into mine.

323
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,750
Now I stand before you.

324
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,083
No king's daughter.

325
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,330
No man's wife.

326
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,826
No brother's sister.

327
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,583
A loose end in time.

328
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,381
And so we all die alike.

329
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,455
No matter into which house we are born.

330
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,631
No matter which gown.

331
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,036
Whether we grace the earth briefly

332
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,576
or for a long time.

333
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,423
I alone tie my bonds.

334
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,078
Whether I have extended hands

335
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,041
or slapped them.

336
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,500
We all face the same end.

337
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,076
Those above have long forgotten us.

338
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,710
They do not judge us.

339
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
In death, I am all alone.

340
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,503
And my only judge...

341
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,705
is me.

342
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,543
Everything's okay. I'm here.

343
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,245
WINDEN MIDDLE SCHOOL
THROUGH THE YEARS

344
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,423
CLASS 6B 1987

345
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,955
9:17 PM

346
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,330
You did great tonight.

347
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,078
Is the play over?

348
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,708
Or did you drag your daughter off stage

349
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,711
to save her
from the sick people in this town?

350
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,745
If you can't stand living here...

351
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,416
why don't you just leave?

352
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,125
Did you see that?

353
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,785
That is who your mother really is.

354
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,246
You and Ulrich,

355
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:32,496
you truly deserve each other.

356
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,833
Let me go.

357
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,288
Tell them what happened back then!

358
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,463
Tell them who their mother really is.

359
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,213
Let's go.

360
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,625
I can't sleep.

361
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,285
Go away.

362
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,423
Can we talk?

363
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:06,996
Yes.

364
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,293
What the fuck was all that back at school?

365
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:33,625
No idea.

366
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,923
Do you think
things will ever be the same again?

367
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,375
You know what I find weird?

368
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,040
You don't actually know your parents,
do you?

369
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:06,875
What they were like as kids or teenagers.

370
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,130
You're a family, but you don't really know
anything about each other.

371
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,753
Can I sleep here tonight?

372
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,376
Okay, but keep
those cold feet of yours on your side.

MISSING

374
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,626
Can we give you a lift?

375
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:15,708
A bit late to be walking around alone.

376
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:19,746
You shouldn't stay out
in the rain so long.

377
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,543
Why not?

378
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,455
Because it's acid.

379
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,415
Chernobyl.

380
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:30,003
People say it's not in the rain anymore,
but I don't believe it.

381
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,923
Hannah, move over. Come on, hop in.
I'll drive you home.

382
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,246
Hannah?

383
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:45,035
Thanks, I'm okay.

384
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,130
Close the door.

385
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,293
-What was up with him?
-Forget it.

386
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:57,328

387
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:32,036
Mads crashed into the glass table
in the living room.

388
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,206
There was so much blood,
like in a horror movie.

389
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,415
But in the end,
it turned out to be just a small cut.

390
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,630
On his chin.

391
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,576
That's how you were.

392
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,331
One minute you hated each other's guts.

393
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:48,416
The next minute you were best friends.
