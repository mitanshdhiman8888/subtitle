1
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,418
<i>Why do we die?</i>

2
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,415
<i>What is death?</i>

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
TIEDEMANN, REGINA
AUGUST 1, 1971 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2019

4
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,583
MOM AND SISTER
CAVE

5
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,496
<i>Could we escape it</i>
<i>if we knew when to expect it?</i>

6
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,293
<i>Is the time</i>
<i>of our departure predetermined?</i>

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,380
<i>Our dying, part of an endless clockwork?</i>

8
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,628
<i>We all have one truth in common.</i>

9
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,706
<i>We are born.</i>

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,041
<i>And we die.</i>

11
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,041
<i>No matter what path we take in between.</i>

12
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,171
LIFE AND DEATH

13
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,000
Your path will always lead you here.

14
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,208
To Elisabeth.

15
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,293
To me.

16
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,293
Time plays a cruel game.

17
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,168
Have you made your decision?

18
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,211
Just one more day

19
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,673
and we can untie this knot
once and for all.

20
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,880
But you must,

21
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,133
as all of us,

22
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,625
do your part.

23
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,210
Will you see it through?

24
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,206
Eva will never achieve her goal.

25
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,626
Her world doesn't deserve to be saved

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
any more than ours does.

27
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:35,713
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,333
We have to go.

29
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,746
To the nuclear power plant.

30
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,043
We don't have much time.

31
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Jonas?

32
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,750
Never mind.

33
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,285
My God, where were you?

34
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,625
We were looking for you all day yesterday.

35
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,665
Kilian said you were with him
and then you just vanished into thin air.

36
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,333
And who are you?

37
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,705
Everything will be okay.

38
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,133
What's wrong?

39
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,416
I have to go now.

40
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,035
Wait at the entrance.

41
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,376
I'll get you out of here tonight at ten.

42
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,498
And if anyone asks what you're doing,
say you couldn't sleep.

43
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,128
My mother changes shifts at 5:00 p.m.

44
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,708
She has a keycard.

45
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,460
She always takes the same route.

46
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,325
We'll bring Mikkel back.

47
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,250
I promise.

48
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,040
I promise.

49
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,786
I'm sorry.

50
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,786
For everything.

51
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,996
<i>One year</i>
<i>after the horrific events in Chernobyl,</i>

52
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:32,133
<i>five high-ranking employees at the reactor</i>
<i>have been given long prison sentences.</i>

53
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:38,078
<i>Meanwhile, German nuclear power plants</i>
<i>have seen increased safety inspections.</i>

54
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,126
Oh, Charlotte. You're back already?

55
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,498
<i>...that German nuclear power plants</i>
<i>are safe.</i>

56
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,583
<i>USA.</i>

57
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,786
<i>German Foreign Affairs Minister</i>
<i>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</i>

58
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,825
<i>addressed the UN General Assembly</i>
<i>in New York</i>

59
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:55,166
<i>and urged global superpowers to take</i>
<i>further steps towards disarmament.</i>

60
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,793
<i>Bremerhaven.</i>

61
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,630
<i>The German research vessel Polarstern</i>
<i>has set out to explore the Antarctic...</i>

62
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,328
Bad day?

63
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,080
<i>The expedition's aim</i>
<i>is to research the hole in the ozone.</i>

64
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,793
Have you ever thought
whether it's possible to turn back time?

65
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Yes.

66
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Yes, I have.

67
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,503
And?

68
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,576
Do you think it's possible?

69
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,753
That you can go back and change things?

70
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,210
You're so grown up now.

71
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,171
Grown up enough.

72
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,501
For a long time now
I've wanted to be able to turn back time.

73
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,671
But my place isn't in the past

74
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,000
nor in the future.

75
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,375
But here,

76
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,708
with you.

77
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,963
Are these my parents?

78
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,288
You said there were no photos.

79
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,041
That's not you.

80
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,785
Those aren't your parents.

81
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,498
That's my son and his wife.

82
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,921
And my granddaughter.

83
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,325
They died in a car accident.

84
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,536
In the night, when it happened, I woke up.

85
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,245
There was a noise downstairs in the shop.

86
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,168
And two women were there.

87
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,748
They looked peculiar.

88
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,380
They were carrying a bundle.

89
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,576
That bundle was you.

90
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,878
They said

91
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,828
that everything would be taken from me
that very night.

92
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,173
And that at the same time,
I would be given everything.

93
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,213
And then I got the call.

94
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,711
On the bridge,

95
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:37,831
a truck had forced my son's car
into the river.

96
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,751
They only ever found
the bodies of my son and his wife.

97
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,293
My granddaughter...

98
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,630
was never found.

99
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,826
This is the only thing

100
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,746
that you had with you.

101
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,878
FOR CHARLOTTE

102
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,328
I don't understand this.

103
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,208
Who are my parents?

104
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,788
Charlotte...

105
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,375
Who am I?

106
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,498
I don't know.

107
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,576
I don't know.

108
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,333
-Charlotte?
-One of your colleagues let me in.

109
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,326
I have questions about
the dead boy in the bunker.

110
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,996
I hope that's okay.

111
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,285
Are you all right?

112
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,826
The planning meeting
for dismantling the facility.

113
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,125
Everyone's getting nervous.
In a year this is all meant to be over.

114
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,831
I never would have thought
it would end like this.

115
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,580
But that's how it is.

116
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,246
There's a time for everything.

117
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,130
When exactly did you come to Winden?

118
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,078
Fall of 1986.

119
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,956
Why?

120
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,461
And when did you start working here?

121
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,543
Around the same time.

122
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,793
So you got the shift schedules?

123
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,128
I was wondering
if you archive the shift schedules.

124
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,705
Long term.

125
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,833
What month is this about?

126
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,130
Not month.

127
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,578
1986.

128
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,581
POLICE

129
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,788
Hello, Claudia.

130
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,753
We need more men!

131
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,583
Come on.

132
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,916
We need to go.

133
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm not going with you.

134
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,955
They're dead, Daddy.

135
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,076
We haven't...

136
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,248
found them.

137
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,751
If they're alive,
why haven't they come back?

138
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,463
Why aren't they looking for us?

139
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,003
They're dead.

140
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
Everyone here is dead.

141
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,415
I don't want to do this anymore.

142
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,420
POLICE

143
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,210
You're from another world?

144
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,665
What do you want here?

145
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,876
I'm here to guide you into the light.

146
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,745
There are two groups out there

147
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,003
who are fighting
for supremacy in time travel.

148
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,333
Light and shadow.

149
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,035
I want you to join our side.

150
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,251
Eva's side.

151
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,501
Eva?

152
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,923
You thought you could trust him,
but you can't.

153
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,673
Who?

154
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,751
Jonas.

155
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,328
He belongs to the shadow.

156
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,458
Jonas?

157
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,543
He's dead.

158
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,423
No.

159
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,666
He's not.

160
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,130
He wants to obliterate both worlds
and destroy the knot.

161
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,878
He doesn't yet know
that's what he'll want in the end.

162
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,463
But all the impulses
on his journey will lead him there.

163
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,575
But Eva wants to save both worlds.

164
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,463
I don't understand.

165
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,418
Jonas said we could change it.

166
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,670
We change one component,
which will change the entire world.

167
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,880
That's what you told him.

168
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,670
Your older self.

169
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,325
A positive feedback loop.

170
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,078
Jonas opened the passage in 2020.

171
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,791
The older Jonas
had shut it prior to that, in 2019.

172
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,578
After it had been opened
for the first time in the summer of 1986.

173
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,171
All three times,
cesium residue was left behind.

174
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,330
A component of the black matter.

175
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,040
Radioactive half-lives.

176
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,078
In each cycle, at all three moments,

177
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:52,128
cesium is brought back into the tunnel
before it has fully decayed.

178
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,578
It expands exponentially ad infinitum.

179
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,753
So that's how the passage was created.

180
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,375
And that's how it must continue
to exist for eternity.

181
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,416
Everything has to happen again.

182
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,581
Jonas bringing the matter
into the passage,

183
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,958
the opening of one of the drums
in the plant triggering the apocalypse.

184
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,378
Everything in this loop repeats itself.

185
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,878
Life.

186
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,000
And death.

187
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,325
WARNING! SECURITY ZONE
NO TRESPASSING

188
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,415
What exactly is in these barrels?

189
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,326
I don't know.

190
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,876
But something happened here
in the summer of 1986.

191
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,998
An accident.

192
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,963
And what remained,

193
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,543
the substance in the barrels...

194
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,330
That makes it possible
to travel through time.

195
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,416
They're bringing the truck
with the barrels in today.

196
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,378
We'll wait until nightfall.

197
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,745
Oh, crap.

198
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
It's fine. Just a scratch.

199
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,920
What's wrong?

200
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,168
That scratch.

201
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,713
She had it.

202
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,790
The Martha who brought me here.

203
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,576
Everything repeats itself.

204
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,996
She wanted to change it.

205
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,458
But if you become her,
everything stays the same.

206
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,955
Why did Eva lie?

207
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,415
She said there was a way to save it.

208
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,501
My world.

209
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,420
I've got no idea about your world,
but this is my world.

210
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
If I can stop the barrels being opened,
if it's possible to stop it all--

211
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,503
And what if that's what she wants?

212
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,040
For it all to happen again?

213
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,875
Maybe she doesn't want us to stop it.

214
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,955
Maybe it's us

215
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,630
who trigger it in the first place.

216
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,286
-Why would she want that?
-Because they're all lying!

217
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,788
The entire time

218
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,995
I've done
what the others have told me to do.

219
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,708
And it just made everything worse.

220
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,916
I have to go back to Eva.

221
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,211
I finally want to know what the truth is.

222
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,961
Jonas.

223
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,166
Jonas, wait!

224
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,633
You need a special invitation, or what?

225
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,285
Coming or not?

226
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,418
Excuse me.

227
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,250
If I walk,
how long does it take to get to Winden?

228
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,581
If I were you, I'd reconsider.

229
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,713
Winden is like a black hole.

230
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,921
Once you're there, you never get out.

231
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,080
You all right?

232
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,383
It's complicated.

233
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:29,081
Almost everything is complicated.

234
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,960
What are you doing here?

235
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,416
It's complicated.

236
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,833
My mother died.

237
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,498
My father lives here.

238
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,496
Until a few days ago,
I didn't even know who my father was.

239
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,710
She told me.

240
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,325
Shortly before she died.

241
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,583
Do you believe it's possible
to bring someone back from the dead?

242
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,540
How's that supposed to work?

243
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,578
You have to get them before they die.

244
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,666
I'm Peter.

245
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,168
Charlotte.

246
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,133
Peter?

247
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,583
Back from school so early?

248
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,708
I didn't go.

249
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,541
What do you mean, you didn't go?

250
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,290
What are you doing here?

251
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,876
I saw Aleksander.

252
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,575
The day Mads disappeared,
Helge was working at the plant.

253
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,535
His shift ended at 6:00 p.m.
Mads disappeared at around 6:21 p.m.

254
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,750
You're not serious, are you?

255
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,130
I don't know why Helge said that.

256
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,458
But he had nothing to do with Mads

257
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,461
or with the boy you found.

258
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,631
He was with us all evening.

259
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,458
Your father may be involved in
the murders of two boys.

260
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,881
-She's not deaf!
-Erik is still missing.

261
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,583
This penny, what does it mean?

262
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,535
Ulrich is right.

263
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,540
It's all somehow connected.

264
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,035
Ulrich?

265
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,790
I have to go back to the office.

266
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:57,921
Hey, wait.

267
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,915
Don't be scared.

268
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,253
Do you live here alone?

269
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,538
I asked if you live alone.

270
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,578
I've no idea when I last ate warm food.

271
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,128
It's time.

272
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,171
You have to let her go, Franziska.

273
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,461
Adam can never be allowed
to untie that knot.

274
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,461
You have to lead them.

275
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,248
Jonas.

276
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,830
Noah.

277
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,881
Elisabeth.

278
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,383
I don't understand.

279
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,955
-Lead them where?
-Down the same path.

280
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,290
Again and again.

281
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,583
We have to preserve the knot.

282
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:42,788
In your world you must do all you can
to do that, as I must in mine.

283
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,961
Jonas. You'll have to guide him.

284
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,631
And then later, defy him.

285
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,000
-How will I know what I must do?
-It's all in there.

286
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,288
We'll see each other again.

287
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,455
In your world.

288
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,293
Soon.

289
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,205
Hold on, wait!

290
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,288
Jonas?

291
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,791
What if it's the truth?

292
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,003
If there can only be one world.

293
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,036
Yours or mine.

294
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,750
You decided long ago.

295
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,246
You want to go back.

296
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,378
To your world.

297
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,963
I didn't want any of this.

298
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,633
You have to believe me.

299
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,325
You didn't want any of this?

300
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,790
Last night...

301
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,746
You didn't want that?

302
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,210
This is wrong.

303
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,630
I'm wrong here.

304
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,963
So this is wrong, huh?

305
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,710
Are you following me?

306
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,785
What do you want?

307
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,995
The keycard.

308
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:38,833
You're crazy.

309
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,075
I don't want to hurt you.

310
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,421
The keycard!

311
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,040
I know you. I knew it right away,
that first day in the hospital.

312
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,631
Where do I know you from?

313
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,125
Mom, stop it!

314
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,538
What did you say?

315
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,423
I'm not your mother.

316
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,290
You come from hell.

317
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,000
The devil sent you.

318
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,333
You're not real.

319
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,423
I got rid of you.

320
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,881
I got rid of you.

321
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,331
Here. You go inside.

322
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,133
I'll grab the rest.

323
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:03,036
Right...

324
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,333
Here we are again.

325
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,040
Should I make us a hot chocolate?

326
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,670
Or are you hungry?

327
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,288
Michael?

328
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,996
Are you hungry?

329
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,995
Mom, is everything all right?

330
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,376
You're bleeding!

331
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,285
Mom, what happened?

332
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,745
Mom, say something.

333
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,876
What is that?

334
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,415
Is that from Ulrich?

335
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,923
You dirty little slut.

336
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,380
You're not worthy
of the name you were given!

337
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,540
I should have gotten rid of you too.

338
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,080
What is this place?

339
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,125
It is what will become of you.

340
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:43,746
Adam and Eva.

341
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:01,828
And thus everything starts over again.

342
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,785
You lied.

343
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,578
You said we could save both worlds,
but we can only save one.

344
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,955
Or is that a lie too?

345
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,000
I want to go back!

346
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,960
Now!

347
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,541
To my world!

348
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,081
Of course you do.

349
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
But there is no way back for you.

350
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,535
What do you mean?

351
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,963
A human being lives three lives.

352
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,288
The first one ends

353
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,456
with the loss of naiveté.

354
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,828
The second...

355
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,826
with the loss of innocence.

356
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,666
And the third...

357
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,128
with the loss of life itself.

358
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,210
Yours ends here and now.

359
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:32,918
What?

360
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:47,131
You have accomplished
what you were sent to this world for.

361
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,206
We've accomplished nothing.

362
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,918
She said we had to stop the apocalypse.

363
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,075
-The barrels in the power plant--
-You'll understand it all

364
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,671
when it's time for you to understand.

365
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,286
Who are you?

366
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,375
I'm sorry.

367
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,708
