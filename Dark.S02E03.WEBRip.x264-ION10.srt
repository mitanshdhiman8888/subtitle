187
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,212
They sent Helge to return today.

188
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,628
Noah's also returned.

189
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,130
I'm not afraid of him.

190
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,090
-You carry the same blood.
-You can't chose your family.

191
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,462
Denying your blood means true freedom.

192
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,257
You said so yourself.

193
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,085
Yes, but our entire lives
are defined by our family.

195

In four days.

197
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,922
Your brother is a blind fool.

198
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:07,297
All the suffering he causes people...
But it will come to an end.

199
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,458
You must give me this.

200
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,090
Not yet. There is still time.

201
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,712
Today?

202
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,298
I wanted to thank you.

203
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,665
For everything.

204
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,665
My mother loves you. Did you know?

205
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,705
She will make you very happy
if you let her.

Heterochromia.

209
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,422
One blue eye

210
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,587
and one brown one.

211
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,167
Did you write this book?

212
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,342
I wondered when this day would arrive.

213
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,008
When we would meet again.

214
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,962
I don't even know you.

215
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,512
But I know you.

216
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,125
It's an endless cycle.

What do you make of all this?

220
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,377
He just turns up out of nowhere?

221
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,168
I wonder

222
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:39,955
if the two things aren't connected.

223
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,632
The killings of those children
and the Doppler boy.

224
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,383
How could he have done it?

225
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,545
He's been locked up for half a year.

226
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,420
He didn't act alone.

227
00:19:56,213 --> 00:20:00,923
-You think an accomplice?
-Let's question the psycho once more.

228
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,587
Maybe he'll talk now.

229
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,923
An accomplice...

230
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,165

Those lyrics.

237
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:44,673
You said
these exact words to me in 1953.

238
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:46,878
But this record

239
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,258
was only released last year.

240
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:00,048
And you said

241
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,800
you had a son yourself.

242
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,632
Why were those the children you murdered?

243
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:11,918
I didn't kill the children.

244
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,837
I wanted to save them.

245
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,045
You said before I was dying.

00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,957
How in the world
did you know I had cancer?

You're as deranged as I am.

250
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:03,172
But why did you never tell us who you are?

251
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,302
Who are you?

252
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:11,513

[Tannhaus]
I am what you might call a fraud.

256
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:32,957
Have you ever heard
the term "bootstrap paradox"?

257
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,458
No.

258
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,707
Well, in a bootstrap paradox

259
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,093
an artifact,

260
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,337
or any information,

261
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:47,132
is sent back to the past from the future.

262
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:52,513
And this, in turn,
creates an infinite cycle

263
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:57,088
in which the artifact doesn't have
a real origin anymore.

264
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:58,802
It exists

265
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,550
without ever having been created.

266
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,170
To put it simply, this book

267
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,585
has traveled back through time.

268
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:11,962
It found me

269
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,797
before I even wrote it.

Do you have an accomplice?

00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,337
If you would talk now

288
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,303
it could very well help your situation.

[guard] It's the medication.

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,300
We have to sedate him.

[Tannhaus] Don't you want to tell me

303
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,630
why you are really here?

304
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,958
You want to know how it all works.

305
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,087
How do you know that?

306
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:05,132
She told me
that you would eventually turn up here.

307
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:08,125
And that I should explain
the device to you.

308
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:11,673
That was... what you said.

309
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,208
Your future self, that is.

310
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:17,882
The paradox is that just a short while ago

311
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:21,513
I wouldn't have been able
to explain any of this to you.

312
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,048
But last year

313
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,590
someone explained it quite clearly to me.

314
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,302
It was another...

315
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,803
time traveler.

316
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:33,303
I think she knew already.

317
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:38,295
She knew how everything would happen,

318
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,010
until this very moment.

319
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,382
She knew that you would come here

320
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:46,423
so I could explain to you,
and therefore her,

321
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,760
how the device works.

322
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,960
[Mrs. Doppler] He seems so strange to me.

323
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:03,552
He's empty inside,
as if he's just a shell.

324
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:10,837
I mean, he never was the brightest child,
but now you would think he was stupid.

325
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,707
He frightens me.

326
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:18,508
And with Bernd gone I don't really know
how to handle the situation.

327
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:22,877
[whispering] Perhaps he's possessed
by the devil.

328
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:26,883
Please take a look at him
and tell me everything is all right.

329
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,383
And he still hasn't spoken?

330
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,262
Helge, come downstairs.
There's someone here to speak with you.

Wherever you go.

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,960
You carry it within you,

335
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:16,707
and it carries you.

336
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,880
It sees and hears
everything you do and say.

337
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:28,125
Your mother is worried about you.

338
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:33,173
Shall we show her there's no reason to be?

339
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:41,008
I'd like you to read something for me.

340
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,920
Would you do that?

341
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,263
"You are my shield,

345
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,052
He can speak!

346
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,630
[Noah] Give him some time.

347
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,420
I'm sure he's just choosing his words
with great care.

348
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:11,588
You can keep that.

349
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,455
Won't you stay a while?

00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:23,803
He has returned...

00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:29,547
to his mother's arms.

353
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,423
He is a miracle.

354
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,338
Never forget that.

355
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,707
[Ines] So what are you doing here?

356
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:53,125
I'm trying to fill in some holes

in just a few of my old case files.

358
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,127
For the sake of closure.

359
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,960
May I speak with the child?

360
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,417
Michael is sleeping.

00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:09,882
In the day?

00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:12,338
He isn't feeling well.

363
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,882
Has Michael mentioned anything at all
about his family?

364
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:21,795
Michael wants to let all of that go.

365

He has a new life now.

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,210
Has he said their names
or spoken about them at all?

367
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,835
First names?

368
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:39,382
Nicknames?

369
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,172
The name Ulrich?

370
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,213
He hasn't ever said that to you either?

371
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:51,628
[sighs]

372
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,210
What about...

373
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,632
any mention of a white devil?

374
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:05,955
No!

375
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:10,338
I don't understand the reason
for all of these questions.

376
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,758
Is it all right
if I spoke with him tomorrow?

377
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,512
-Yeah.
-All right, then.

378
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,125
If you can think of anything else

379
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,455
give me a phone call.

380
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,127
Good.

381
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:38,005
[oppressive music]

382
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,552
SLEEPING PILLS

383
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,257
[clears throat] I, um...

384
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,545
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

385
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:57,917
I have bad dreams.

386
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:01,632
One other thing.

387
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,052
Do you have a photo of the boy?

388
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,457
Just for the file.

389
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,510
[clears throat] Just for the file, right?

390
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:28,837
Just for the file.

391
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,915
[door opens and closes]

392
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,550
[dismal music]

393
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:57,838
[Noah] What are you doing here?

394
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:03,923
Did Claudia send you?

395
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:11,627
If you think Adam will take you back,
you're wrong.

396
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:14,085
You've chosen your side.

397
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,210
There is no salvation for you.

398
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:23,672
I know where the last pages are.

399
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,458
And I know
how long Adam's been looking for them.

400
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:31,258
Don't you think
he'd do whatever it takes to get them?

401
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,088
I don't believe you.

402
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:38,882
She would never have told you
where they are.

403
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,382
[Agnes] Claudia has them.

404
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:00,803
In return, I want you to tell Adam
that I wish to come back.

405
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,920
Before the new cycle begins.

406
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:05,707
You'd forsake her?

407
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,172
Surely you can't hate your own sister
the way you hate her.

408
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:18,207
[dismal music]

409
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:26,205
You might consider it
an offering of peace.

410
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:57,507
[knocking at door]

411
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,463
Yeah.

412
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:07,303
There's someone here to see you.

413
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,165
Oh, all right.

414
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,803
You can go in.

415
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,130
[door closes]

416
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,382
Can I help you?

417
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,958
One brown eye and one blue eye.

418
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,340
That is rare.

419
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,378
Like my daughter.

420
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,625
You're much too good a person.

421
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,048
Like you have always been.

422
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,418
The world doesn't deserve you.

423
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,760
Excuse me, but...

424
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,837
do I know you?

425
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:18,423
I am here
because I have to tell you something.

426
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,335
Forgive me.

427
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,133
Forgive you for what?

428
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,960
Everything.

429
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,337
You never deserved any of this.

430
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,378
But sometimes
the good ones get hit the hardest.

431
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,133
[mysterious music]

432
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,958
I don't understand.

433
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:53,173
You will one day.

434
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,297
And I want you to know

435
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:00,303
that I'm incredibly sorry

436
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,170
that things happened
the way they happened.

437
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:11,545
Either you tell me
what this is all about right now

438
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,457
or please leave my office.

439
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,705
I truly am sorry.

440
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,383
[eerie music]

441
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,510
[breathing heavily]

442
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:50,382
I've been trying to reach you all day.

443
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,758
The gentlemen from the press
waited for over an hour.

444
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,630
And...

445
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:57,455
-And?
-Um...

446
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:59,917
I rescheduled the meeting
for 10:30 tomorrow.

447
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:03,455
After that you have a meeting
with the union representatives.

448
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,760
Cancel all appointments.

449
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:12,263
One more thing. Your father...

450
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,093
He's here.

451
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,882
I didn't know where to put him.

452
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:38,963
What are you doing here?

453
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,712
Why didn't you call ahead?

454
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:48,045
I wanted to talk to you.
It won't take very long.

455
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,460
Right now is a really bad time.
You can't just show up here unannounced.

456
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:56,207
Set up an appointment
with my secretary that suits us both.

457
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:58,962
Next week, maybe.

458
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,457
I have cancer.

459
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:07,415
Prostate.

460
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:12,133
I didn't want to worry you.

461
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,053
But the cancer is spreading.

462
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,880
And I thought

463
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,710
it's best that you know.

464
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,673
I...

465
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,800
I don't know what to say to you.

466
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:32,707
It's okay.

467
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,712
I just wanted you to be informed.

468
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,835
I'll be on my way.

469
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,915
I'm sure you have
plenty of work to do here.

470
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,800
Papa.

471
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,667
[gloomy music]

472
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:18,705
-You're finally back.
-Yes, my princess know-it-all.

473
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:22,297
Where's Mama?

474
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,165
You look kind of sad.

475
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,625
I have a secret. Think you can keep it?

476
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,918
I believe I saw a witch today.

477
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:04,922
-There are no witches.
-Yes, there are.

478
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,958
This one is real.

479
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:10,957
What did she look like?

480
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,380
Long white hair.

481
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,760
Like in the books.

482
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:19,007
And what did she say?

483
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,170
That she was sorry.

484
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,172
That doesn't sound like a witch.

485
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,090
Well how would you know that?
You've never seen one.

486
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,963
Those for Mom?

487
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,090
Yeah.

488
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:55,012
You're much too good a person, Papa.
The world doesn't deserve you.

489
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,297
[mysterious music]

490
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:06,955
Are you okay?

491
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:12,338
Yeah.

492
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:16,375
Just déjà vu.

493
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:22,377
[old Egon Tiedemann] <i>I used to think</i>
<i>the worst thing that could happen in life</i>

494
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,842
was to lose your child.

495
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,205
But we can't do anything about it.

496
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,880
You try to keep them close
for as long as you can.

497
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,838
And, inevitably, they always leave us.

498
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,127
Parents,

499
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,130
children,

500
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:48,463
they only share the same path

501
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:51,087
for a small portion
of their time on earth.

502
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:53,837
At the end...

503
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:57,087
they're miles apart from each other.

504
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:06,758
Last winter

505
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,545
a stranger in Winden turned up.

506
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,592
Just a boy.

507
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,090
He said something peculiar to me
at the time.

508
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:20,007
It doesn't make any sense, but...

509
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:25,547
Or maybe the cancer
is already driving me crazy.

510
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,383
Do you know this child?

511
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,380
He is here?

512
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,798
Where is he?

513
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,962
You knew that he was here.

514
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,342
You knew this entire time, didn't you?

515
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:57,262
Where is he? Where is he?

[whimpering]

00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,760
Tell me where he is right now!

Oh, it's you. I...

526
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,803
It's... It's not ready yet.

527
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:36,087
It will take 33 years
until the device is ready.

528
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,762
This thing, this... the blueprint.

529
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:40,458
I don't understand what it is.

530
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,460
I've seen that before.

531
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:55,798
[Claudia] All our lives
we wonder where our journey will take us.

532
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,922
This is yours.

533
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:02,005
-You can keep it. I don't need it anymore.
-Why are you giving it to me?

534
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:04,553
I will be dead soon.

535
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:06,707
I...

536
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:08,257
don't understand.

537
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,093
You will.

538
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,377
One day.

539
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,085
And then we will meet again.

540
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,762
Before you die?

541
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:20,508
No, after.

542
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,005
How?

543
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:25,343
How would that be possible?

544
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:28,173
Time is an illusion.

545
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,587
You'll show me
how the device works.

546
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:35,172
But I don't even know what it does.
