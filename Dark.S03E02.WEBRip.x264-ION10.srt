1
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,918
Get changed.

2
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,580
Martha?

3
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,791
This can't be.

4
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:07,996
You...

5
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:09,875
You're alive.

6
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,673
That isn't Martha.

7
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,003
What's going on?

8
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,501
He's right.

9
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,326
I'm not Martha.

10
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,206
Not your Martha.

11
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,496
I promised to make everything right again,

12
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,288
so none of it happens.

13
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,876
So you don't die in my world,
and I don't die in yours.

14
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,668
So that Ulrich... Dad...

15
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,075
Mikkel...

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,670
so they all come back.

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,416
So everything finally comes to an end.

18
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,923
THE SURVIVORS

19
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,745
SEPTEMBER 22, 1987

20
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,631
-<i>This is Ines...</i>
-<i>And Michael Kahnwald.</i>

21
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,208
<i>We're not at home right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

22
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,540
<i>Mrs. Kahnwald, this is Mr. Dietmann</i>
<i>from the Federal Postal Service.</i>

23
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,171
<i>I've been trying to reach you</i>
<i>for three months.</i>

24
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,126
<i>We'll disconnect the line next month</i>
<i>if you don't pay the outstanding bills.</i>

25
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,248
<i>Please call me back as soon as you can.</i>

26
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,923
MISSING FOR THREE MONTHS

27
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,375
I think you did the right thing.

28
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,211
Even if the coffin is empty.

29
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,673
To... to get closure.

30
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,038
At least you've got each other.

31
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,578
For support.

32
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,498
At least we've got each other.

33
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,420
Now we can stand hand in hand
by an empty coffin

34
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
and finally get closure.

35
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,958
Tell them where you were
when Mads disappeared.

36
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,876
He was fucking her!

37
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:53,375
When my son disappeared,
he was screwing Claudia Tiedemann.

38
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,713
If only you'd put as much energy
into finding your own son

39
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,461
as you're wasting
on finding your mistress...

40
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,378
Then maybe Mads would be back by now.

41
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,790
I have no idea what you're talking about.

42
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
WHERE IS CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN?

43
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,168
"I have no idea
what you're talking about."

44
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,416
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HEAD
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26,

45
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,210
THE DAY HER FATHER
WAS FOUND DEAD AT HOME.

46
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:30,421
SEPTEMBER 22, 2020

47
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,581
<i>The world's scientists</i>
<i>are still seeking an explanation</i>

48
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,166
<i>for the events of June 27, 2020.</i>

49
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,920
<i>The epicenter of the global catastrophe</i>

50
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,380
<i>is still thought to be</i>
<i>the small town of Winden.</i>

51
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,578
<i>A French research team</i>
<i>believes it is possible</i>

52
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:54,536
<i>that our world stood still</i>
<i>for a fraction of a nanosecond on June 27.</i>

53
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,495
<i>Tidal forces may have diverged</i>
<i>as a result.</i>

54
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,083
<i>This would explain</i>
<i>the global spring tides,</i>

55
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,286
<i>weather phenomena,</i>
<i>and disturbances of electrical systems,</i>

56
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,625
<i>which in turn could explain</i>
<i>the great number of airplane crashes</i>

57
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,878
<i>and the simultaneous loss of power supply</i>
<i>to nuclear power plants worldwide.</i>

58
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,378
<i>There is no sign</i>
<i>of the situation stabilizing--</i>

59
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,286
How are you?

60
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,746
Mom...

61
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,790
You're leaving again already?

62
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,168
I'll be back before the sun sets.

63
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,501
In five days
all of this will be closed off.

64
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,668
We're evacuating the entire area.

65
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,418
We have orders to seal off
the restricted area.

66
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,125
Seal off?

67
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,788
Walled in.

68
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,171
Why are you doing this to her?

69
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,878
-You're from a parallel world?
-Where Mikkel doesn't disappear?

70
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,828
I'm mute?

71
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,461
And Jonas doesn't exist?

72
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,380
Where we're all already dead
because your world ends just as ours does?

73
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,575
That's bullshit.

74
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,245
I'm not dead.

75
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,825
I'm here.

76
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,498
How did you find us?

77
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,378
How did you know where we were?

78
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,746
Jonas told me.

79
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,708
I thought Jonas didn't exist
in your world.

80
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,415
He traveled there.

81
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,785
From your world to mine.

82
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,535
You're lying.

83
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,080
I was never in your world.

84
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,710
Did you write the letter?

85
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,785
What do you really want?

86
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,830
Did Adam send you?

87
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,166
What did you use to travel?
I want to know what you used to travel!

88
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,883
You're running late today.

89
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,171
The machines aren't running yet.

90
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,245
You have a visitor.

91
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,383
So you're the reason

92
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,246
for his mood being
even worse today than usual.

93
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,746
Don't let me scare you.

94
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,961
People may say

95
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,251
I'm not quite right in the head,

96
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
but I assure you...

97
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,631
that I see more

98
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,498
than those among us who can see.

99
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,745
-Do you know this boy?
-Nope.

100
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,580
-Do you know this boy?
-No. Sorry.

101
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,416
-Do you know this boy?
-No. I'm sorry.

102
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,375
-Do you know this boy?
-Nope.

103
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,918
Ulrich?

104
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,998
Do I know you?

105
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,036
Do you maybe know where this boy is?

106
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,210
{\an8}WHO HAS SEEN MICHAEL KAHNWALD?
12 YEARS OLD

107
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,625
Maybe the madman got him after all.

108
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,125
What madman?

109
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,038
Don't touch me, Typhoid Mary!

110
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,583
Hey, Ulrich.

111
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,535
Ulrich?

112
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,170
I thought you weren't coming today.

113
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,075
Katharina.

114
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,076
We'll be late for history class.

115
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,710
Katharina Albers?

116
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,753
Hello?

117
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,001
I remember.

118
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,285
What's with her?

119
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,916
The old bat's not all there.

120
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,631
Come on.

121
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,578
Hey!

122
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,786
Hey!

123
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,955
What madman?

124
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,501
What madman?

125
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,205
A guy escaped
from the nuthouse this summer.

126
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,075
He tried to drag Michael into the cave.

127
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,535
It was in the paper.

128
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,790
You keep your mitts off Mikkel!

129
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:28,996
And Ulrich!

130
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,038
VISITOR'S PASS - NIELSEN, TRONTE

131
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,668
I've already told all this to the police.

132
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,078
It won't take long.

133
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,875
I promise.

134
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,786
And this is supposed to be
for the newspaper?

135
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
The week before Claudia disappeared...

136
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,003
did you notice anything?

137
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,293
Her appearance was always
very important to her.

138
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,083
So neat.

139
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,125
But that week...

140
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,041
she wore outfits twice.

141
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,293
She forgot appointments. Her hair...

142
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,125
I think...

143
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,666
it all had to do
with the old woman and the dog.

144
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,881
She showed up a few days
before Mrs. Tiedemann disappeared.

145
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,578
She said the dog belonged to her,

146
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,080
but didn't take it with her.

147
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,076
After that, Mrs. Tiedemann was somehow...

148
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,416
different.

149
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,248
Excuse me.

150
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,876
We're looking for...

151
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,825
a woman, late 40s.

152
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,245
Blonde hair.

153
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,376
And a girl. Seventeen years old. Red hair.

154
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,495
If they're not on the wall, then...

155
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,416
they're not here.

156
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,633
This is good.

157
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:24,538
If they're not here, then...

158
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,498
Maybe they traveled.

159
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:41,078
CALL FOR WITNESSES
WE ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE

160
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,706
MISSING
TIEDEMANN, CLAUDIA

161
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,920
Hey!

162
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,293
The man from the asylum.

163
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,583
Why didn't you tell me?

164
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,916
I thought I'd already made that clear.

165
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,166
You can barge in here as often as you want

166
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,420
demanding information
on the whereabouts of Michael Kahnwald.

167
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
You won't get any.

168
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,673
Someone tried to kidnap
my son this summer.

169
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,785
Your son?

170
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,330
You can neither identify yourself

171
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,666
nor do you have any proof
you're actually the boy's mother.

172
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,460
You're not registered anywhere.

173
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,076
You don't have a birth certificate.

174
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,960
And, astonishingly,
you don't even want to reveal your name.

175
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,331
No one has seen him for three months.

176
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,673
He doesn't go to school.

177
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,580
He's not at home.

178
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,290
The man from the psychiatric ward...

179
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,746
I remember that.

180
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,496
My mother told me about it.

181
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,001
Maybe...

182
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,206
Maybe he tried to do it again.

183
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,288
Now listen very carefully.

184
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,171
The boy hasn't disappeared.

185
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,665
Child Protective Services know
where Ines and Michael Kahnwald are.

186
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,420
After this summer's events it was decided
it was best to give the boy some time out.

187
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,420
And the madman is back in the closed ward,

188
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,710
as he has been for the past 34 years.

189
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,998
What did you just say?

190
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,416
Just to make it absolutely clear,

191
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,750
if I see you here again,
I'm putting you in protective custody.

192
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,673
-What's his name?
-Goodbye.

193
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,080
What's the man's name?

194
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,746
Hello, Regina.

195
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,786
Is that your dog?

196
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,206
It was my mother's.

197
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,788
Should I give you a ride?

198
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,540
Strange.

199
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,793
Looks like Gretchen.

200
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,998
I think that's why she kept her.

201
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,826
Do you think...

202
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,213
the disappearance of Mads and my mother...

203
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,130
that they're connected?

204
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,626
I don't know.

205
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,333
The week
before she disappeared, did she...

206
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,665
say anything to you about an old woman?

207
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:34,746
And...

208
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,713
did she say anything to you about me?

209
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,205
I...

210
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,956
just thought maybe she'd said something.

211
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,576
I'll...

212
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,665
get out just up ahead...

213
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,748
and walk the rest of the way.

214
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,080
Well...

215
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,793
if you need anything...

216
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,710
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

217
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:23,131
I am one of the few survivors
of the apocalypse of June 27, 2020.

218
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,751
Almost three months have passed
since the catastrophe.

219
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,880
It's still unclear
what exactly led to the events in Winden.

220
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,000
But the God Particle...

221
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,253
If we can stabilize it,
maybe it is a way back.

222
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,955
Back to the past.

223
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,828
Maybe we can save them.

224
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:44,996
All of them.

225
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,833
I'll take a look around upstairs.

226
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,250
I'm looking for food.

227
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,038
And you?

228
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,785
MOM AND SISTER

229
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,625
Where do you sleep?

230
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,325
CAVE

231
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,126
What's going on?

232
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,133
Why are you here?

233
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,501
Are you following us?

234
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,876
I told you,
we want nothing to do with you.

235
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,535
You want to protect her, I know.

236
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,670
So do I.

237
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:51,831
And I will.

238
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,790
After you were killed.

239
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:15,876
TANNHAUS
MACHINERY FACTORY

240
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,501
I'm sorry.

241
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,630
About Jonas.

242
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,833
Since we've been here...

243
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,455
he's...

244
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,383
He's been different.

245
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,916
How did you get here?

246
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,503
We traveled.

247
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,496
Exactly at the moment everything blew up.

248
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,540
He didn't want to come here.

249
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,246
It just happened.

250
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,415
The device is empty.

251
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:29,041
It's not that easy to get nuclear fuel
from the future in 1888.

252
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,251
And this?

253
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,535
What is this?

254
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,248
The workshop?

255
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,081
The blind man?

256
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,500
Does he know who you are?

257
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,828
Where you come from?

258
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,080
Come along.

259
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,500
I need to show you something.

260
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,208
The young woman.

261
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,788
Is she one of you?

262
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,875
A traveler?

263
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,326
When I found you, it was a sign.

264
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,786
A godsend.

265
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,001
Whatever that woman means to you,

266
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,673
don't forget what we are going to create.

267
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,583
Paradise.

268
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,711
Every calamity can be reversed.

269
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,495
Every pain,
destroyed before it even comes to be.

270
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,998
A perfect world.

271
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,498
<i>Sic mundus...</i>

272
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,826
<i>creatus est.</i>

273
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,503
Excuse me.

274
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,075
Can I help you?

275
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,455
Can I help you?

276
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,626
I...

277
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,713
I...

278
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,205
I'd like to visit someone.

279
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,041
He's been here for 34 years.

280
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,036
The inspector?

281
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,418
Do I know you from somewhere?

282
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,583
Somehow you look familiar to me.

283
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,880
Are you related to him?

284
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,291
He's my husband.

285
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,576
I see.

286
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,381
You're one of them.

287
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,631
One of those women
who go for madmen or prisoners

288
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,538
because they can't find anyone else.

289
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,043
I'm off duty. Come back tomorrow.

290
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,331
That's St. Christopher.

291
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,040
The patron saint of travelers.

292
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,995
He renounced the devil
and carried the creator into the world.

293
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,293
My mom had one just like that.

294
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,631
I've traveled a very long way.

295
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,825
Let me see him.

296
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,288
Please.

297
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,580
He was just released from solitary.

298
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,790
My colleague will let you out.

299
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,580
Ulrich.

300
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:46,293
Katharina.

301
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,168
I'll get you out of here.

302
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,285
I promise.

303
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,633
Excuse me?

304
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,083
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

305
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,375
What do you want?

306
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,455
I...

307
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,460
I'll call security.

308
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:22,881
No.

309
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:24,916
You won't do that.

310
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,416
Jasmin.

311
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,381
Right?

312
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,580
Hell is empty.

313
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,538
And all devils are here.

314
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,418
At some point you have to decide.

315
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,633
For us.

316
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,083
Or against us.

317
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,170
I...

318
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,495
saw Regina.

319
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,383
She's all grown up.

320
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,378
I've wondered all these years...

321
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:12,665
if she...

322
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,286
Claudia never said who the father was.

323
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:28,831
You're right.

324
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,040
I have to decide.

325
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,293
Mom?

326
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,168
Tronte.

327
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,791
Regina.

328
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,245
What are you doing here?

329
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,170
I'm so sorry.

330
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,541
But it has to happen.

331
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,075
I don't understand.

332
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,328
She said...

333
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,536
it's the only way to save you.

334
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:41,291
MOM AND SISTER
CAVE

335
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:50,543
What did he say to you?

336
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,380
What do you mean?

337
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,211
The boy.

338
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,130
Forget him.

339
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,128
I'm not a little kid anymore.

340
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,923
Why do you carry that around
everywhere you go?

341
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,670
What's in there?

342
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,460
Where are Mom and Franziska?

343
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,748
We'll find them.

344
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:23,246
SEPTEMBER 22, 2053

345
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:36,035
Everything will be okay.

346
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,461
Clear the table.

347
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,035
I said, clear the table.

348
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,831
Must I always repeat myself?

349
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:56,918
What is this?

350
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,830
This is a kind of secret lodge.

351
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,421
Old Tannhaus is the only member left.

352
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,286
His father was convinced he could
override the rules of space and time.

353
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,075
He dedicated his entire life to this.

354
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,495
And so did his son.

355
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,038
They tried to build a time machine?

356
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:31,878
Jonas is trying to rebuild things
the way he saw them.

357
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,173
He's been here before.

358
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:36,825
Not now.

359
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,423
In the future.

360
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,423
He asked you something earlier.

361
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,793
Whether Adam had sent you.

362
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:55,958
He said...

363
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,290
that Adam killed Martha.

364
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,791
Who is this Adam?

365
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,083
He didn't tell you guys?

366
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,455
He is Adam.

367
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:16,706
Jonas.

368
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,333
We don't know our end.

369
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,383
But our end...

370
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,165
knows us.

371
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,751
Salvation...

372
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,751
or damnation.

373
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,920
We can indulge in
the illusion of free will,

374
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:56,921
but we cannot escape our ultimate destiny.

375
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,955
The choices we make in this world
may be different...

376
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,673
but nevertheless,

377
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:21,128
they converge on the same moment.

378
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:27,883
Things may not happen in the same way,

379
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,040
or at the same time.

380
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,285
But they happen.

381
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:38,171
You believed a world without you
would be a better one.

382
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,038
But they will all die.

383
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,880
Mikkel.

384
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,326
Mikkel will die.

385
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,165
Everyone will die.

386
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,035
The apocalypse takes place in my world

387
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,995
just as it does in yours.

388
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,543
But in mine, that's in just three days.
