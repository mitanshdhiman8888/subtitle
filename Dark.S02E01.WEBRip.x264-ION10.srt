Okay? If you had any idea of the shit
I've been dealing with.

177
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,880
-I mean...
-The shit you've been dealing with?

178
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,340
In case you forgot,
my father and brother are still missing.

179
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,842
My mother is crazy
and doesn't give a shit about me.

180
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:50,382
And you're telling me about
how much shit you've been dealing with?

Nuclear power was, is,

Nothing is more reliable,

The outside world, however,

192

In seven days
our plant will close for good.

193
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:02,665
This will be
a life-altering adjustment for all of us.

00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,463
And the decommissioning?

202
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:52,382
What is at ground level will be untouched
and become part of the greenfield.

203
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:56,303
Any radiation will be traced back
to the previous use of the pools.

Who are you?

207
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:54,552
Why are you here?

208
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:59,462
How did you have a key?

209
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,667
It's my key.

210
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,133
What are you saying, your key?

211
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,633
I know this is all going to sound
like it makes no sense.

212
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:16,378
But hear me out.

213
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,340
Do you remember the yellow bike?

214
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,552
The bike you and Dad
gave me for my eighth birthday.

215
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,337
I drove it into a ditch
on the very first day.

216
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,592
I got that cut on my arm, here.

217
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,050
Get out! [inhales sharply]

00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:42,797
Here...

00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,802
Dad was making pancakes.

220
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:54,125
He dropped the pan
and spilled hot oil right there.

221
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:00,007
I disappeared from your life
over half a year ago.

222
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,803
And you found me over 33 years ago.

223
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,625
I knew it was you right away.

224
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,920
It was raining that day.

225
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,508
You and Grandpa
wanted to drive me there in the car.

226
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:15,708
You said there was still acid rain
because of Chernobyl.

227
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,798
I was wearing my yellow jacket.

228
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:26,838
It's me.

229
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,213
It's me, Mom.

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,760
Jonas.

231
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,875
How can it be you?

You've taken your first step.

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
Adam will be proud of you.

245
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,085
I had that same feeling.

246
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,088
It will pass.

247
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,672
Adam...

248
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:09,705
-Why did he take us in?
-Certain things are still hidden from you.

249
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,710
But they will come to light.

Little by little.

[gloomy music]

252
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,877
It's all a matter of timing.

253
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:24,915
How do we know
what's right and what's wrong?

254
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:28,008
What's good

255
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,755
and what's evil?

256
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:33,298
By listening to our inner voice.

257
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,590
And choosing not to follow anyone

258
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:38,838
but ourselves.

259
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:44,625
Our true character shows not only
in our deeds, but also in their purpose.

I am you.

Why did Mom keep it all?

Great-Grandpa died ages ago.

I think it's because it's the only thing

Why?

He called you right before he disappeared.

313
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:17,632
The call lasted exactly 12 seconds.
Most likely a voicemail recording.

What did he want?

315

Nothing.
He had the wrong number.

"not expectations.

You might just be surprised,
but not disappointed."

328
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:34,758
You expected a different kind of colleague
and got me instead.

and yet not the same.

374
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:45,415
Just as you're not the same person
who came through that door an hour ago.

375
