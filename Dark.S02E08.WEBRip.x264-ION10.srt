you won't leave this bunker for anything.

183
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,263
No matter what.

184
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,668
I'm so sorry.

185
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:14,255
[door locks]

186
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,173
POLICE

187
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:56,125
MISSING

188
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,877
[door opens]

189
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:02,133
Charlotte. I thought you were still sick.

190
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,383
-Is Clausen here?
-No.

191
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:08,213
Clausen had Aleksander arrested
and got a search warrant for the plant.

192
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,207
He's on his way there.

193
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,092
Charlotte.

194
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,508
I... have something to tell you.

195
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,843
At the... nuclear facility...

196
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,918
Aleksander buried something
in the concrete.

197
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,843
Radioactive waste.

198
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,012
And I helped him.

199
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:52,915
That's the cause.

201
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,262
-What?
-It's all connected.

202
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,548
He said it has to do with something
in that facility.

203
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,512
-Jonas knew that.
-Jonas was found?

204
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,588
No, he traveled here from the future.

205
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,505
We have to go!

206
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,168
Wöller!

207
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,258
Come on!

208
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,375
FOR CHARLOTTE

209
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:20,213
[Peter] Damn it, Charlotte, where are you?
Is Franziska with you?

210
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,257
Call me when you get this.

211
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,338
[quiet, dismal music]

212
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,337
We are leaving.

213
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,262
To go where?

214
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,045
I don't think I'm...

215
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,710
certain what to believe.

216
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,837
But he said

217
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:55,512
only those in the...

218
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,008
the bunker...

219
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,628
will survive.

220
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,085
What about Mom and Franziska?

221
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,838
It will all be okay.

222
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,585
[unsettling music]

223
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,920
FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

224
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,005
[plant worker] I don't quite
understand what you're hoping for.

225
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,798
The site is huge

226
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,550
and tomorrow
there's the controlled shut down.

227
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,170
My mother always said

228
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:38,755
just because a task is daunting
doesn't mean you can't deal with it.

229
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,048
What's behind this door?

230
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,460
The, um...

231
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,957
the cooking bank of the old reactor.

232
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,012
It hasn't been used since the '90s.

233
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,008
I'm going to have a look.

234
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,170
You can't open the door to have a look.
Radiation.

235
00:21:56,963 --> 00:22:00,843
And, honestly, I don't think
you'd find anything in there anyway.

JUST AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

242
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,585
[Jonas] Katharina.

243
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,342
How do you work this machine?

244
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,415
[Jonas] Where did you get it?

245
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,463
How can Mikkel come back home?

246
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,512
Even if I told you, it can't happen.

247
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:51,092
You don't want him to come back.
Then you wouldn't even have been born.

248
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,092
I wish it was that simple.

249
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,303
But things in the past
just can't be changed.

250
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,882
Mikkel can't come back
because I already exist.

251
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:04,087
Mikkel belongs here. You don't.

252
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,547
You shouldn't exist at all.

253
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,263
Yeah.

254
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:14,458
I'd give my life for his if I only could.

255
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,263
But I can't, damn it!
Because my future already exists.

256
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:23,052
Just like you won't be able
to bring Mikkel back.

257
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,302
So why did you decide to come?

258
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,668
Well, I thought
I could prevent the origin.

259
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,592
It's beyond our control.

260
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,963
Adam is the endpoint.

261
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:39,755
I might not be able to prevent myself
from becoming what he is.

262
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:43,092
But what's become of me, I can stop.

263
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,758
I know that I've been lied to.

264
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,380
You never saved anyone.

265
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,513
None of them.

266
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:23,088
We can't escape our fate, none of us.

267
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Neither you nor I.

268
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:34,125
You're not waging war against God.

269
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,128
You're waging it against humankind.

270
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,133
[threatening music]

271
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,710
Here are the last pages.

272
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,665
You used me.

273
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,843
Had me do what you wanted.

274
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,923
But now I know what I have to do.

275
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,128
Claudia was right.

276
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:02,708
You still don't understand
how this game is played.

277
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:07,917
What are you waiting for?

[gun clicks]

279
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,920
It's time who plays this game with us.

280
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:20,045
You think it's your destiny to kill me,

281
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,340
but that's not your fate,
just as it isn't mine to die here and now.

282
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,550
Only when we've freed ourselves of emotion
can we be truly free.

Only when you're willing to sacrifice
what you hold dearest.

00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,303
Charlotte is your daughter.

286
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,085
She is Elisabeth's daughter

287
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,258
and her mother.

288
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,633
There is no man without guilt.

289
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,760
None of them have earned a place
in your paradise.

can only be undone

295
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:26,258
by destroying it completely.

296
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,420
We cannot

It's Jonas.
He's reopened the passage.

315
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,418
It's that thing that Mikkel went through?

316
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,053
Yes.

It was the same noise. Like the cave.

With Jonas?

Noah was right.
He was right about everything.

Bring the machine to the bunker,

-He wants me to go there.
-To the bunker?

350
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,260
[Bartosz] Shit.

351
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,462
Something's going on.

352
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,168
I'm going.

353
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,010
If they're not home in half an hour
we'll go join your dad.

Where are Mom and Franziska?

00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,798
I have no idea.

356
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,923
[Wöller] So this Noah guy says
he's your father

357
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:13,625
and he's from the future...
or, no, the past.

358
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:17,463
And he says the apocalypse
starts in Winden today?

359
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:21,167
And you think this is all connected
to the containers in there?
