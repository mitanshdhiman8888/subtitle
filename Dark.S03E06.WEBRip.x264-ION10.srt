1
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,125
I promise you.

2
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,918
I'll make this right.

3
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,461
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

4
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,461
<i>you promised</i>
<i>to make everything right again.</i>

5
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,535
<i>I want you to know you will do that.</i>

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,670
<i>You must never lose hope</i>
<i>that there is a way out of this maze.</i>

7
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,671
<i>A way to save me...</i>

8
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,456
<i>and you.</i>

9
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,415
<i>But we both have to make sacrifices,</i>

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
<i>do unimaginable things,</i>

11
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,078
<i>to untie the knot at the end.</i>

12
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,286
<i>Each fate in this knot</i>
<i>is tied to the next.</i>

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,291
<i>A thread,</i>

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,998
<i>red like blood,</i>

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,375
<i>that connects all our deeds.</i>

16
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:30,788
<i>In light...</i>

17
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,380
<i>and in shadow.</i>

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,826
Why is Adam doing this?

19
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,575
Why are you locking me up?

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,830
<i>But the apocalypse</i>

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,285
<i>must take place.</i>

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,576
<i>You must let me die</i>

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,670
<i>so I can live.</i>

24
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,170
<i>We have to let some things go</i>
<i>before they find their way back to us.</i>

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,378
<i>We are a perfect match.</i>

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>Never believe anything else.</i>

27
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:27,003
LIGHT AND SHADOW

28
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,003
DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

29
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,166
Martha?

30
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,166
Man, where were you?

31
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,080
Mom cried all night long.

32
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,383
Is everything okay?

33
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,791
Hey.

34
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,580
What happened?

35
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,166
What's wrong?

36
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,671
He was absolutely right.

37
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,495
Bartosz was right.

38
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,825
What he said in the forest...

39
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,883
about the end of the world.

40
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,288
The nuclear power plant. Today.

41
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,705
Bartosz's father is trying
to cover up an accident.

42
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,921
The barrels.
I know this sounds totally crazy, but...

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,880
the world's coming to an end today.

44
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,286
Have you got a screw loose?

45
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,245
When did you last sleep?

46
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,036
Are you even listening?

47
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,125
The...

48
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,746
I haven't got time for your psycho crap.

49
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,881
I don't know what's going on with you.

50
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,578
But it's not fair
to let Mom down like that.

51
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,543
She doesn't deserve that.

52
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,375
He had to die.

53
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,496
You two are wrong...

54
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,788
in his world.

55
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
And in ours.

56
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,375
I know what you're feeling.

57
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,503
But you'll learn to let him go.

58
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,328
Everything will run its course,

59
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,748
just as fate determined...

60
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
for our world...

61
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,126
and his.

62
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,375
Why did you lock me up?

63
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,288
You promised me there would be a way
to change everything...

64
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,133
so that the apocalypse doesn't happen.

65
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,535
You lied to me
just like my older self lied to me.

66
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Sic Mundus.

67
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,788
Old Tannhaus.

68
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,133
He firmly believed
he was creating a paradise,

69
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
where we would all be free
from our destiny...

70
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,628
and free of pain.

71
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,875
A world beyond your world and my world.

72
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,041
But I...

73
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,826
have finally realized
what paradise really is.

74
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,378
Eternal darkness,

75
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,041
in which nothing exists.

76
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,075
But for that...

77
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the apocalypse must happen.

78
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,036
In my world...

79
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,671
and in yours.

80
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,541
Jonas!

81
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,625
Jonas!

82
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,628
Let me out! Jonas!

83
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:30,713
6 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

84
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,378
<i>Where are the barrels?</i>

85
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,461
<i>I want you to wait.</i>

86
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,038
I don't care about that.

87
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,455
You do what I say, Obendorf.

88
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,671
Got it?

89
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,420
Dad? Is everything okay?

90
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,496
I know I said I'd stay home today,
but something came up.

91
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,713
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,628
It's all right.

93
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,250
I have to tell you something.

94
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,245
Someone is blackmailing me.

95
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,498
What?

96
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,285
With something...

97
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,165
that happened a very long time ago.

98
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:39,248
MURDER IN MARBURG
STILL UNSOLVED 33 YEARS LATER

99
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,713
Sometimes we make decisions in our lives
that we can never undo.

100
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,753
My name isn't Aleksander.

101
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,383
It's Boris.

102
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,130
Boris Niewald.

103
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,791
But it was an accident.
You have to believe me.

104
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,666
I am not a murderer.

105
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,631
What about Mom?

106
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,538
Did Mom know about this?

107
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Your mother is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

108
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,460
She saved me from all that.

109
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,328
And I never even told her the truth.

110
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,166
Bartosz.

111
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,923
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,711
Charlotte.

113
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,536
May I come in for a second?

114
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
Thanks.

115
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,498
I need to speak to Ulrich. Is he here?

116
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,206
No. He's still in the shower.

117
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,543
Could I maybe wait? It's important.

118
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,288
How are you?

119
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,956
Okay.

120
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,631
And at home? Is everything fine?

121
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,416
Now you listen to me...

122
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,708
Ulrich belongs to me.

123
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,455
And that's not going to change.

124
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,463
Charlotte.

125
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,331
-What are you doing here?
-I just wanted to show you something.

126
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,581
Drop by with Peter sometime.

127
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,955
We can all go out together.
While I still can.

128
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,711
-Are you done in the bathroom?
-Of course.

129
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,293
-What are you doing here?
-Your cell was off.

130
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,705
Don't ever do this again.
Never come here uninvited.

131
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,630
The microscopic examinations
of the two pennies are in.

132
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,245
And...

133
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,500
And?

134
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,576
And what?

135
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,881
WINDEN POLICE
EVIDENCE

136
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,418
This is the penny I found in the bunker.

137
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,831
And this is the penny Helge had on him.

138
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,165
At first I thought it must be a mistake,
that the photos were labeled incorrectly.

139
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,923
But this here,

140
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,916
this little groove.

141
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,540
It is exactly identical.

142
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,670
I don't know how,
but it's one and the same coin.

143
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,960
But this one here, Helge has had it
as long as I've known him.

144
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,126
I know it makes no sense at all,

145
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,128
but...

146
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,916
But?

147
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,960
It's as if the penny...

148
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,670
had somehow traveled through time.

149
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,996
-Where's Helge now?
-Still in pre-trial custody.

150
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,375
Ulrich!

151
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,383
Oh, you startled me.

152
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,375
Where were you?

153
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,666
Did you cut your hair?

154
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,038
What happened?

155
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,956
Do you believe in fate?

156
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,960
I don't know.

157
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,458
No.

158
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,671
I believe we take our lives
into our own hands.

159
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,535
That we decide which path we take.

160
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,251
I know I...

161
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,706
I'm probably the last person
you want to talk to, but...

162
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,750
if you do want to...

163
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm here.

164
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,291
Your dad and I...

165
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,920
A lot of things may be different now...

166
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,705
but that doesn't necessarily mean
it's bad.

167
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,750
No, it doesn't.

168
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,708
Are you going somewhere?

169
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,291
I promised someone
I'd take care of something.

170
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,706
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

171
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,876
GOD PARTICLE

172
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,790
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

173
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
Stop!

174
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,253
Jonas.

175
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,628
You're alive.

176
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,915
I killed him.

177
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,625
Why is he still alive in his world?

178
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,535
The switch point...

179
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,918
at the junction in the loop of time.

180
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,708
<i>The moment</i>

181
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:06,456
<i>that allows things to run</i>
<i>in one direction or the other.</i>

182
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,960
<i>You bring him to our world,</i>

183
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,170
or you don't.

184
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:20,455
A line that meets itself again in a loop.

185
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,133
<i>Two possible paths:</i>

186
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:29,331
<i>along the outer edge of the line,</i>
<i>or along the inner edge of the line.</i>

187
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,878
<i>And yet it is the same line.</i>

188
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,126
<i>Two overlapping realities.</i>

189
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,325
On one of these paths, he dies.

190
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,213
On the other, he doesn't.

191
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,883
Both possibilities recur in the loop

192
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,788
again and again.

193
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,251
One triggers the other.

194
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,543
Quantum entanglement.

195
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:14,078
Adam has tried to sever
this entanglement for the past 33 years,

196
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,126
so what is growing inside you

197
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,998
will never come to be.

198
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,628
But it is impossible.

199
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,706
Our worlds

200
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,916
cannot be separated from one another.

201
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,288
Every step Jonas takes is guided by us.

202
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,748
He cannot escape his fate.

203
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,576
What is this?

204
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,383
This was left over...

205
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,538
after the catastrophe.

206
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,828
The God Particle.

207
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,708
And this here?

208
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,538
What is this?

209
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,880
I've seen what it will become,

210
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,380
in the future.

211
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,503
There's no way back now.
The cave collapsed. There's nothing left.

212
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,503
The passage no longer exists.

213
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,923
But this here...

214
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,286
if I find out how it works, I can go back.

215
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,535
Then I can save them. Martha and Mikkel.

216
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,961
I can save them all.

217
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,210
How did you even find me?

218
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,576
How did you know I was here?

219
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,036
The device.

220
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,125
-The matter it needs--
-The device. Do you still have it?

221
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,250
Where is it?

222
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,576
It doesn't work.

223
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,955
Maybe it all had to happen this way first,

224
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,455
for things to change next time.

225
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,080
The substance in the device,

226
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,748
you and I brought it
into the passage again.

227
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,878
We changed the variables of the equation.

228
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,575
-Maybe it will work next time.
-I don't have time to wait 33 years!

229
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,041
Am I supposed to lie to myself again
to have things happen the same way?

230
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,211
But this time I'll be on the other side
of the bunker door?

231
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,036
Why didn't she say anything?

232
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,285
Your older self.

233
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,671
She knew Martha would die.

234
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,878
How she'd die.

235
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,633
Why should I trust you?

236
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,168
The matter in the nuclear power plant.

237
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,576
I know what it is.

238
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,250
I can help you save Martha,

239
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,705
to save them all.

240
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:36,291
3 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

241
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,630
Bartosz?

242
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,173
Martha?

243
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
Can I come in?

244
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,788
Yes.

245
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,003
33 years ago, there was an accident
at the nuclear power plant.

246
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:15,416
Somehow the accident caused
some strange substance to form.

247
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,543
And your father helped
cover everything up.

248
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,956
The whole time,
that stuff has been in the caves.

249
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,786
It's all connected.

250
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,575
The substance...

251
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,328
it triggers it.

252
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,036
Today.

253
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,131
We have to talk to him.

254
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,708
Triggers what?

255
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,381
The apocalypse.

256
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,293
POLICE

257
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,125
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

258
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,043
The time of death must have been
just before the body was found.

259
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,626
Is it possible
that he's been dead for a long time?

260
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,501
That his body had been preserved somehow?

261
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,076
Preserved?

262
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,036
What do you mean "preserved"?

263
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,746
Everything okay?

264
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,996
The scar on his chin...

265
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,375
Ulrich?

266
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,921
The boy in the bunker.

267
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,633
You said you killed him.

268
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,253
But you didn't mean him.

269
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,173
You meant Mads.

270
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,673
The boy from the bunker
looks just like Mads.

271
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,995
How can that be?

272
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,253
She... she said I had to do it.

273
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,133
Who?

274
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,628
Do what?

275
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:41,961
Send him to the future.

276
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,375
To fill the gaps.

277
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,665
The pennies.

278
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,883
What does this mean?

279
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,670
-I have to stop him.
-Stop who?

280
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,375
Stop who?

281
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,003
You.

282
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,285
You can go.

283
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,963
<i>And this Jonas guy is dead now?</i>

284
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,423
And you killed him.

285
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,331
Well, not you, but...

286
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,963
some other you?

287
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,285
I was there.

288
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,575
In the future.

289
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,380
Nothing's left.

290
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,291
Nothing.

291
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,881
It all has something to do
with your father.

292
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,538
He can't be allowed to open the barrels.

293
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,753
Bartosz.

294
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,915
Please.

295
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,291
Charlotte, it's Aleksander.

296
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,920
I...

297
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,786
Can you come to the nuclear power plant?

298
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,293
I want to show you something.

299
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,961
Come on out!

300
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,581
Adam's waiting for you.

301
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,415
Stop.

302
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,633
Take it off!

303
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,460
-What?
-Your clothing.

304
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,458
Take it all off.

305
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,166
Why are you doing as he says?

306
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,826
We, the chosen few, must fill the gaps.

307
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,251
So you can find your way here,
and Adam his...

308
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,166
and we'll finally find salvation.

309
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,326
We have waited
a long time for this moment.

310
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,626
You know what to do.

311
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,423
1 HOUR UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

312
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
What do you think it means?

313
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,075
The birds? The light?

314
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,956
The boy in the bunker?

315
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,328
Martha is losing it.

316
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,211
She thinks
the apocalypse will happen today.

317
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:27,705
If we die today, then together.

318
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,535
Together.

319
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,961
What's this about?

320
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,165
It's better if you see it yourself.

321
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,540
Tick, tock.

322
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,831
Tick, tock.

323
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,876
Tick...

324
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,423
tock.

325
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,535
Charlotte, it's me.
Listen, the stuff with the pennies...

326
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:39,785
I know it sounds crazy, but the same thing
happened with the body in the bunker.

327
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,133
Have them run a DNA test.

328
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,878
I don't know how, but...

329
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,626
the boy in the bunker,

330
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,501
he's my brother. It's Mads.

331
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,461
Call me back when you get this.

332
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,923
Who are you?

333
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,883
Can't you guess that?

334
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,288
Magnus?

335
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,710
You're from the future.

336
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,503
But not from yours.

337
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,668
What's going on?

338
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,955
They lied to you.

339
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,038
Your older selves.

340
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,285
They don't want to prevent the apocalypse.

341
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,581
They're the ones
who are responsible for it happening.

342
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,040
But there is a way to change everything.

343
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,881
But you have to choose our world...

344
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,128
and trust him;

345
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,455
Jonas.

346
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,381
Jonas is alive?

347
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,705
In our world.

348
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,455
And he knows where the origin is.

349
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,670
But before that, you must save Jonas
from the apocalypse in his world,

350
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,790
and bring him into your world.

351
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,830
You're all out of your minds.

352
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,001
You can't stop
what's happening here, but...

353
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,633
if you come with us,

354
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,921
you can prevent it...

355
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,916
another time.

356
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,496
What is that?

357
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,631
Martha, what's this all about?

358
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,246
Martha?

359
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,003
You have to come with us.

360
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,920
-Come where?
-He doesn't belong with us.

361
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,213
He belongs with the others.

362
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,501
They will save him.

363
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm sorry.

364
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,245
Martha, wait!

365
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,423
<i>It's time.</i>

366
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,331
<i>Adam has moved</i>
<i>each of his pieces into position.</i>

367
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,583
It's time

368
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,961
that we do the same.

369
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,325
This knot has given us all life,

370
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,876
and we are its keepers.

371
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,673
In both worlds.

372
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,541
He'll never be able

373
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,251
to untie the knot.

374
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,666
In all these years, he hasn't understood

375
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,880
how everything is really connected.

376
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,463
How everything ends and begins.

377
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,633
Not only in our world,

378
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,330
but also in his.

379
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,331
We are...

380
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,626
destiny.

381
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,035
We build the walls...

382
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,538
of this labyrinth.

383
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,745
Each of us shapes the paths

384
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,673
and extends their hand.

385
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,251
Bartosz, you must save yourself
to save our lives.

386
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,536
Claudia, you must guide yourself
to be our eyes in Adam's world.

387
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:17,786
Egon, you must create your past
to preserve the family tree.

388
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,581
Noah...

389
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,290
you bring love

390
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,423
to make everything new.

391
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,875
Every darkness is followed by light.

392
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,038
With every death comes a life.

393
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,423
You brought me into your world.

394
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,921
You promised me I could change it.

395
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,670
Why are you doing this?

396
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,208
Where are the others?

397
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,035
Where did you send them?

398
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,211
They are all fulfilling their destinies.

399
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,083
Magnus and Franziska.

400
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,956
Charlotte and Elisabeth.

401
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,130
Silja and Agnes.

402
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,665
They're perpetuating the cycle,

403
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,075
so that you and I can be here now.

404
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,075
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,128
That we've come to the end.

406
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,043
What's growing inside you,

407
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,245
the origin,

408
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,213
must die.

409
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,583
But it can't be killed by normal means.

410
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:07,081
It's born of both worlds,

411
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,503
and the energy of both worlds is necessary

412
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,673
to destroy it.

413
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,746
The apocalypse in my world,

414
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,043
and the apocalypse in your world.

415
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,456
This here is the end.

416
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:29,246
A machine that not only crosses time,
but also space.

417
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,213
It focuses the energy of both apocalypses

418
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,881
onto this one point.

419
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,075
Your son only exists

420
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,876
because the matter exists.

421
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:47,963
And now he will die through the matter,
and all of us with him.

422
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,921
None of this...

423
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,998
will exist anymore.

424
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,831
Both worlds will extinguish one another.

425
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,205
Absolute annihilation.

426
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,458
You're insane.

427
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,668
There is no hope.

428
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:21,995
No salvation.

429
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,461
No paradise.

430
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,170
We're wrong,

431
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,631
you and I...

432
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,583
in your world

433
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,958
and in mine.

434
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,540
Jonas.

435
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:53,996
Jonas!

436
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,080
Jonas, please don't do it.

437
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,745
Jonas!

438
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,458
Jonas!

439
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,380
Jonas!

440
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,285
Don't. Jonas, please!

441
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:06,958
Jonas!

442
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:10,958
Jonas, please!

443
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,126
No!

444
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,165
Jonas!

445
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:36,876
No, no!

446
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,788
<i>The beginning is the end,</i>

447
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,916
<i>and the end is the beginning.</i>

448
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,708
<i>Every connection in one world</i>

449
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,291
<i>must also be closed in the other world.</i>

450
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,036
<i>Everything is connected.</i>

451
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,133
<i>In light</i>

452
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:07,671
<i>and in shadow.</i>

453
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,535
POLICE

454
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:05,581
TANNHAUS
MACHINERY FACTORY

455
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,670
VOLUME CONTROL ROOM

456
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,416

No!
