1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,170
Man has always puzzled over his origin.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,170
His genesis.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,170
Created by God?

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,170
Or a product of evolution?

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,170
If we could see yesterday and tomorrow

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,170
at the same time,

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,168
the origin and the end,

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,330
the entire universe in a single moment,

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,326
we might finally find answers

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,206
to the biggest questions of all.

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,706
What is man?

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,171
Where does he come from?

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,040
What drives him?

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,666
What is his purpose?

15
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,290
EVERYTHING IS NOW

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,250
AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT
NUCLEAR POWER FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD!

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,286
The boys they found
at the construction site...

18
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,381
Do you think
someone did the same thing with him?

19
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,288
Or...

20
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,581
maybe I gave him
too much of a scolding about the pants.

21
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,790
Maybe that's why he ran away.

22
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,578
Where are you going?

23
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,625
To the police.

24
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,131
Good morning.

25
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,536
Doppler's here.

26
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,075
In your office.

27
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,921
Says his boy has disappeared.

28
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,538
Maybe you were right
about there being more to come.

29
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,831
There was a man here yesterday.

30
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,878
He said that his son had disappeared.

31
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,461
He wanted to know
if one of the dead children was his boy.

32
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,751
What man?

33
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,463
I don't know, but...

34
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,286
he asked about Doppler's boy.

35
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,915
Tell the officers and put out an APB.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,880
And not a word to Doppler!

37
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,575
Mr. Doppler.

38
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,710
Mr. Kahnwald told me that...
your son has gone missing.

39
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,920
Yes, since yesterday.

40
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,633
And when was that exactly?

41
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,538
My wife said it was around three o'clock.

42
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,078
Mr. Tiedemann.

43
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,576
I want you to find my son.

44
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,708
Whatever it costs.
I don't care about anything else.

45
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,375
The nuclear plant, anything at all.

46
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,883
Just bring me back my son.

47
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,496
Gretchen!

48
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,208
Gretchen!

49
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,883
Here, Gretchen!

50
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,958
Come here!

51
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,535
Gretchen!

52
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,998
You almost look like James Dean
with that haircut.

53
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,713
The girls in Winden
will be after you in droves.

54
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,041
You'll see.

55
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,415
Do you have a girlfriend?

56
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,000
Why did you leave where you come from?

57
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,581
Are you bank robbers on the run?

58
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,043
My mother wanted a change.

59
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,496
Your mother is a very beautiful woman.
I've never seen anyone so elegant.

60
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,170
I feel like the Queen of England
has invited me to tea.

61
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,633
Turn around.

62
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,460
You're beautiful.

63
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,331
The Queen would be glad to have you visit.

64
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,875
It's yours.

65
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,875
No. What would Egon say?

66
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,498
What could he say?

67
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,875
How long were you married?

68
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,288
Fifteen years.

69
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,961
It's been nearly ten for Egon and me.

70
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,496
But somehow everything has changed.

71
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,206
He has changed.

72
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,423
He's not home as much as he used to be.

73
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,416
His work.

74
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,501
What kind of work did your husband do?

75
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,750
He was a pastor.

76
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,880
But I can't say he was a man of faith.

77
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,210
Do you miss him a lot?

78
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,213
He wasn't a good person.

79
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,041
Sometimes I think it's good he's dead.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,330
And that I'm free.

81
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,383
I can't accept it. I'd better take it off.

82
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,498
I prayed to God

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,750
to get rid of the child
before it was ever born.

84
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,535
And after I had him, I prayed every day

85
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,211
that something would befall him.

86
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,253
Because he may not be Bernd's child.

87
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,536
Because maybe he wasn't a child
created out of love, but...

88
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,290
That's what's in my head.

89
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,538
Every day.

90
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,745
I can't escape it.

91
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,463
It's my fault.

92
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,956
We are all full of sin.

93
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,706
No pure human being exists.

94
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,003
But no matter what we do,

95
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,503
we never fall any lower
than into God's hands.

96
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,041
And what if they aren't God's hands?

97
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,631
What if they are the hands of the devil?

98
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,208
God sent me to you. Did he not?

99
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,961
We don't meet the people we meet
by accident.

100
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,420
We touch the lives of others
and are touched ourselves,

101
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
and thus God's hands guide us
to our true destiny.

102
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,293
Let us pray.

103
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,415
Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,

104
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,580
I will fear no evil...

105
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,876
for you are with me...

106
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,881
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

107
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,208
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

108
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,173
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

109
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,630
Surely your goodness and love
will follow me all the days of my life,

110
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,538
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

111
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,125
Stop there!

112
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,205
Stop!

113
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,706
Police!

114
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,538
Stop!

115
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,173
Stop!

116
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,915
Stop! Police!

117
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,245
Stop!

118
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,711
Hands up!

119
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,538
What did you do to the two boys
at the construction site?

120
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,998
Where's Helge?

121
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,253
That was you too.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,750
The two boys? That's impossible.

123
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,785
They can't be there. I changed that.

124
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,995
What did you change?

125
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,825
The course of time.

126
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,246
Helge's dead.

127
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,883
Helge will never be able to kill again.

128
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,745
You're a madman!

129
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,830
Go on, turn around.

130
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,381
Turn around!

131
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,325
Down! On your knees!

132
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,328
But I changed it.

133
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,080
Get up!

134
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
But I changed it.

135
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,245
Piss off.

136
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,883
I just wanted to know,
is Ulrich still in prison?

137
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,125
They have to release him today.

138
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,501
Did Tiedemann say who told him?

139
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,955
And you and Ulrich?

140
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,706
-What about us?
-I don't know.

141
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,461
Won't your mom freak out
if you keep seeing him?

142
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,171
I don't care.

143
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,540
Nobody's going to come between us.
That's love, you know.

144
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,330
It's stronger than hate.
But you don't get that yet.

145
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,213
If I find out who told the cops that...

146
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,498
I'm going to clobber them.

147
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,833
Maybe it was Regina.

148
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,833
I mean, Tiedemann is her grandfather.

149
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,043
See you.

150
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,830
I've been a police officer
for over 40 years.

151
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
Your face.

152
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,495
Your stare. I know that stare.

153
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,001
I know that you've got something to hide.

154
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,173
That you've got
something to do with all of this.

155
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,500
-I can feel it in my bones.
-Maybe it's cancer.

156
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,380
You might want to get that checked out.

157
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,881
I want you to stay away from our family.

158
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,956
And I'm going to make sure
you're taken off Mads' case.

159
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,128
Gretchen?

160
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,710
I can't believe you were in jail.

161
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,125
That's really harsh.

162
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,921
Why does Tiedemann have it in for you?

163
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,421
He thinks I'm the Antichrist.

164
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,211
Hey, Tiedemann!

165
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,711
Damn four-eyes!

166
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,330
I know what you did.
You trying to get me back for the summer?

167
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,666
It was a game. We wouldn't have left you
hanging there all night.

168
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,580
We couldn't have known
you were so damn fragile!

169
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,626
I have to go.

170
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,923
See this? My mom did this. And why?

171
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,923
-Because you fed your grandpa bullshit!
-I didn't. Honest.

172
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,920
Rape!
Is that the best you could come up with?

173
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,250
Come on, Katharina!

174
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,540
You make me sick!

175
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,710
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop!

176
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,286
-Screw off! It's none of your business.
-I told you to stop.

177
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,670
And I told you to screw off.

178
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,458
Apologize to her.

179
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,035
I said you should apologize.

180
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,578
And how do I know it's real?

181
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,581
You two get the hell out of here,
and fast.

182
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,706
And if you hurt her again,

183
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,576
I'll finish you.

184
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,245
Everything's okay.

185
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,576
Thanks.

186
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,081
You're bleeding.

187
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,826
-It's not so bad.
-You have to see a doctor.

188
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,916
We have bandages at home.

189
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,423
My mother isn't home.

190
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,750
I can do it.

191
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,708
What's your name?

192
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,333
Aleksander.

193
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,173
Tell me exactly what happened
in the summer.

194
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,080
I already told you.

195
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,326
An incident.

196
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,125
-In the volume control system.
-That's not good enough for me.

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,040
The connections to the chemical
feed-in system were corroded.

198
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:23,205
Hydrogen gas must have collected
in one of the tubes.

199
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,131
Boom!

200
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,831
It wasn't a precaution.

201
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,830
-That's why the tubes were changed.
-It is what we make of it.

202
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,206
And what the reports say.

203
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,625
We were lucky.

204
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,538
Only an insignificant amount
of radioactive material leaked out.

205
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:46,575
We had the entire floor removed
and stored everything in a safe place.

206
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,996
You call that a safe place?

207
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,833
As safe as any other
official interim storage facility.

208
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,631
-Who knows about it?
-It happened during the nightshift.

209
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,500
The shift supervisor,
a handful of employees, Helge.

210
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,503
No one will talk,
they all got a fat bonus.

211
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,535
Don't make
a bigger deal out of it than it is.

212
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,253
In the night...

213
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,423
Was there more? Did anything else happen?

214
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Anything strange?

215
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,583
In the cave, anything...

216
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,626
-Anything the explosion may have...
-Just what might have happened there?

217
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:47,831
Do you believe that Hannibal
marched over the Alps with elephants?

218
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,706
There are no truths, just stories.

219
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,286
And the story of this city
is now in your hands.

220
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,285
Is our power plant safe?

221
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,785
Can something like Chernobyl
happen in our plant?

222
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,211
You decide what story you want to tell.

223
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,671
10:30 A.M. INTERVIEW: HELGE DOPPLER
WHY NOT FOREST PATH?

224
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,205
Helge?

225
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,083
Helge!

226
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,288
Aleksander Köhler.

227
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:13,581
Born January 21, 1965.

228
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,536
A young man is here to see you.
He said he's your daughter's friend.

229
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,380
-Her friend?
-Yes.

230
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,578
He's looking for work,
if I understood him correctly.

231
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,080
Yes.

232
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,790
I'm Aleksander.

233
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:19,996
So you're a friend of my daughter's?

234
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,495
And all this time
I thought she didn't care about boys.

235
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,498
I'm new in town. Looking for work.

236
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,081
Regina told me
you might be able to help me.

237
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,536
-Do you have training?
-I'm a metalworker.

238
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,670
I can work. Hard.

239
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,208
I'm a fast learner.

240
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,206
You're not from here?

241
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,745
All I'm asking for is a chance.

242
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,503
I'm sorry.

243
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,633
We don't need anyone at the moment.

244
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,291
But maybe we will soon.
Where can I reach you?

245
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,035
I'll just come by again tomorrow.

246
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,583
Why doesn't it work?

247
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,128
It will. Be patient.

248
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,711
Do you think Einstein
would have given up so fast?

249
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:58,535
It is the fate of pioneers
to persistently pursue their aim.

250
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,875
To believe, although no one believes.

251
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,245
I don't want to do this anymore.

252
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,665
Why would God want any of this?

253
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,538
Yes.

254
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,921
Why would God want any of this?

255
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:25,251
After looking into hell,
as you have, it can never be forgotten.

256
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,633
It becomes a part of you.

257
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:32,828
And the idea of God, of Jesus the Savior,
becomes a thread of hope you cling to.

258
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,463
All of us who know the darkness
long for the light, but...

259
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,421
there is no God!

260
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,710
God didn't make this hole among us.

261
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,041
God doesn't have a plan.

262
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,170
There is no plan at all.

263
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,330
There's nothing but chaos out there.

264
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,578
Pain...

265
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,961
and chaos!

266
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,960
People are bad.

267
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,961
Malicious, evil.

268
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,460
Life is nothing but a spiral of pain.

269
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,578
And the world is doomed to be destroyed.

270
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,076
But this here...

271
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,041
This is our ark.

272
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,540
And I'm Noah.

273
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,173
If we can harness this energy,
we can change everything.

274
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,080
Then we decide the world's fate,

275
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,826
far removed from all the evil
and from all pain.

276
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,248
We'll create a time machine

277
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:47,828
that reorders everything,
the beginning and the end.

278
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:05,003
Charlotte, the question isn't
who kidnapped the children, but when?

279
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:09,753
I was right. Helge Doppler.
Not now, but in 1986.

280
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,043
Call me back immediately
when you hear this.

281
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,036
Where's Ulrich?

282
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,325
I thought he was with you.

283
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,626
I tried to reach him,
but his phone is off.

284
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,918
-Was he not here yesterday either?
-Don't you know?

285
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,751
-Do I know what?
-He's suspended.

286
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,168
I thought it was better
if he was with you guys.

287
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,330
It's better if he's with us?

288
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,036
You think we sit at home holding hands?

289
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,923
I'm an idiot!

290
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,130
Our son is missing, and he's got
nothing better to do than screw that slut.

291
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,791
No, Charlotte, it isn't better this way!

292
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,083
I have to go.

293
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,538
Here.

294
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,206
Where did you get it?

295
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,955
I found it under the bridge.

296
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:40,128
Just because we fuck doesn't mean
you have to know everything about me.

297
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,500
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

298
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,995
I want to know who you are.

299
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,380
Who you really are.

300
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,170
Not today, okay?

301
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,878
Hey, it's me.
Call me back, for crying out loud!

302
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,291
Franziska?

303
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,210
Martha.

304
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,538
Why is it that we all keep secrets
from one another?

305
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,253
Some things
you just want to keep to yourself.

306
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:30,293
-Katharina! This is a surprise.
-Where is he?

307
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,246
Who?

308
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,963
Don't act so stupid. Ulrich!

309
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,831
Is he here?

310
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,538
No.

311
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,963
Why would he be here?

312
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,958
You lying piece of shit!

313
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,133
How long has it been going on?

314
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,578
A month? Half a year?

315
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,826
Or longer?

316
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,381
I...

317
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,415
-I...
-I... I... I... !

318
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:02,125
I don't know where my son is!
And I don't know where my husband is!

319
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,538
My husband! Do you understand?

320
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,581
Did you fuck here?

321
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:11,955
Or here?

322
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,041
Here!

323
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,170
Or in my house? In my bed?

324
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,540
He isn't here.

325
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:20,996
Is it fun for you?

326
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:22,996
Yeah?

327
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,380
Does it turn you on?
Destroying the lives of others?

328
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,498
My life and my children's lives?

329
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,040
Did you think about that when you
stuck your scrawny ass out for him?

330
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,713
It's over.

331
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,460
It's over.

332
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,043
I ended it.

333
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,455
I never wanted any of it.

334
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:30,538
But...

335
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,293
he just didn't let up.

336
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,501
You know how he can be.

337
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,665
He wanted to leave you.

338
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,535
I told him that was crazy.

339
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,956
He said that he didn't love you anymore.

340
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,423
That he loves me.

341
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,208
But I want you to know
that it's over now, Katharina.

342
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:07,921
It's over.

343
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,330
Can I help you?

344
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,245
You must be Bartosz.

345
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,496
I'm Claudia, your grandmother.

346
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,126
Is your mother home?

347
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,630
My mother told me
you died before I was born.

348
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:11,078
I'm sure your mother
told you lots of stories about me.

349
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,331
Only some of them are true.

350
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:17,996
It looks much different than it did.

351
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,883
There was no addition.

352
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,416
Why did Mom tell me you're dead?

353
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,630
For your mom, I'm sure I am.

354
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,130
I wasn't a particularly good mother,
you know.

355
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,293
You're a lot like the two of them.

356
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,333
Your eyes.

357
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,078
Your chin.

358
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:41,206
You look a lot like your parents.

359
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,331
If you're not dead,

360
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,458
where were you all these years?

361
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,170
That's a long story.

362
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,498
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

363
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,633
Regina won't be home till late.

364
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,208
-Are you going to wait or...?
-Not today.

365
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,206
I have to take care of something.

366
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:13,421
I want you to give her this.
Will you do that for me?

367
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,751
That was before.

368
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,290
Before that summer
and everything else that followed it.

369
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,918
I made lots of mistakes back then.

370
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,955
Believe me, if I could turn back time,

371
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,003
I would do lots of things differently.

372
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,671
Yes, that's good.

373
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,288
That's good.

374
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,253
Just a second.

375
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,380
Do you recognize it?

376
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,753
All these years
I've wondered why I kept it.

377
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,500
But there's a time for everything.

378
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,583
Don't worry.

379
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,041
The contents are in safe keeping.

380
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,880
What do you want?

381
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,288
Why do some people have everything
and some nothing?

382
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,381
Why do you and Regina
have a beautiful home

383
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,538
and I can't even pay my electrical bill?

384
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:16,173
Why does fate predestine
a good life for some and not for others?

385
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,250
-Do you want money?
-I don't want any money.

386
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,543
I want you to do me a favor.

387
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,165
I want you to destroy Ulrich.

388
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,536
I want him to lose everything.

389
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,288
Everything.

390
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,328
How am I supposed to do that?
What do you have in mind?

391
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:53,165
I don't give a damn how you do it
or who you pay, just destroy him!

392
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,461
Boris Niewald.

393
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,631
Interesting name.
I think it suits you much better.

394
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,205
Hello.

395
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:45,788
Hello.

396
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,793
-I have to go.
-You have to go?

397
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,998
Can you tell me what's going on?

398
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,080
I've been trying to reach you for days,
and you don't even write back!

399
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,003
What was that after rehearsal?

400
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,380
You just make out with me.

401
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:23,501
Did you think, "The chick's unstable,
so I'll take what I can get"?

402
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,708
God, say something!

403
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,998
It was wrong.

404
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,543
-What was wrong?
-The thing with us.

405
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,461
It wasn't right.

406
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,376
Because of Bartosz?

407
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,035
No, not because of Bartosz.

408
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,206
Because of us.

409
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:08,788
It...

410
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,461
We're just not a good match, okay?

411
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,708
We're not a good match?

412
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,285
Yeah, we're not a good match.

413
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,041
The whole thing is wrong.

414
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,250
We're wrong.

415
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,463
So this is wrong?

416
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,671
I'm sorry.

417
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,666
I want you to do me a favor.

418
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,501
I need information on Ulrich Nielsen.

419
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:25,043
-Anything that could be useful.
-Okay.

420
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,825
And what'll we do with the truck?

421
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,206
In a few days,

422
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,746
when everything has calmed down,

423
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,043
we'll bring the barrels back.

424
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,538
WHEN IS MIKKEL?

425
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,708
You were right.

426
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,495
Everything you predicted has happened.

427
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,415
Did you think about my offer?

428
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,205
Yes.

429
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,630
I have work for you, but on one condition.

430
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,538
You can't speak of it.

431
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,036
With anyone.

432
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,205
When do I start?

433
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,290
Blowjob, 50 euros.
You can feel me up between the legs too.

434
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,286
Well, forget it then.

435
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,708
You have no idea what you're missing.

436
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:24,708
Can I help you?

437
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,000
We're actually closed.

438
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:40,213
I think I have something
that could interest you.

439
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,668
I want you to build this for me.

440
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,173
What's that supposed to be?

441
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:59,793
It's something
that will set the course of time straight.

442
