1
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,380
Mom?

2
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:21,996
Mads?

3
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,003
Who are you?

4
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,416
Where are my parents?

5
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,036
-Who are you?
-Do you know where he is?

6
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,083
-Do you know where Mads is?
-You're hurting me.

7
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,246
What are you doing here?
Say something.

8
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,916
When is he coming back?

9
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:39,461
PAST AND PRESENT

10
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,415
Ines, can you do
the night shift today too?

11
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,710
Mrs. SchÃ¼ttler's daughter has a fever
and I have to take Benni to soccer.

12
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,210
-Since you have no...
-No family.

13
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,245
-That's not what I meant.
-It's not a problem.

14
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,083
Thanks.
And please, don't tell Dr. Reimann?

15
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,830
-Mum's the word.
-Thanks.

16
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,076
The news.

17
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,995
November 5, 1986.

18
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,456
After the mysterious disappearance
of an 11-year-old boy

19
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,081
in Winden over four weeks ago,

20
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,036
criticism of local investigators
is growing ever louder.

21
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,205
The circumstances
of the case are puzzling.

22
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,581
Despite an extensive search,

23
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,246
Winden Police have been unable to find
a single piece of useful evidence.

24
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,673
The police are therefore continuing to ask
for the public's assistance.

25
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,670
- The chemical plant fire in Switzerland...
-Tiedemann.

26
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,000
- ...is doing damage to local waterways.
-Where?

27
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,881
- Toxic chemicals are entering the Rhine...
-I'm on my way.

28
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,205
In times like these...

29
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,038
one must...

30
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,831
face one's own fears.

31
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,416
Because the future...

32
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,170
the future belongs to the bold.

33
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,205
Not to the doubters,
those forever stuck in the past.

34
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,210
Would you take a look at yourself?
You can't go to school like this.

35
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,711
Sometimes I think you have no idea
what it is I do.

36
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,673
Food, clothes, fencing classes.
Who pays for all of that?

37
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,630
And you can't even bother
combing your hair.

38
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,633
Look at yourself.
You look like a limp dishrag.

39
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,286
Hey, Regina, I'm talking to you.

40
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,920
This is a huge deal for me,
and I won't let you spoil it.

41
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,463
The board's decision to entrust this post
to a woman for the first time...

42
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,003
MISSING
MADS NIELSEN

43
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,381
It's awesome.

44
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,826
-Know what the song's about?
-No.

45
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,036
A man who kidnaps a girl
and takes her to the forest,

46
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,375
just because she's wearing red lipstick.
In the end he kills her.

47
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,708
That's heavy.

48
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,753
My dad says lipstick
is only for prostitutes.

49
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,713
Anyway, I like Nino D'Angelo
way more than Falco.

50
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,081
Hannah, you're as square as they come.

51
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,213
Come on, Katharina. Don't be so nasty.

52
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,460
What are you looking at?
Weren't you at Ulrich's place earlier?

53
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,916
Are you new here?

54
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,751
I...

55
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,213
I'm looking for my mom.

56
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,128
This isn't kindergarten.

57
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,498
She's the principal here.

58
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,711
Mr. Hubert?

59
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,378
He may be a fag,
but he's certainly not a woman.

60
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,130
Isn't this Winden?

61
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,581
Aren't you a bit young to drop acid?

62
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,133
You guys got history now?

63
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,041
-Morning, Claudia.
-Morning.

64
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,753
-Your first day as boss.
-Yes.

65
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:57,041
My dad told me
the board voted unanimously for you.

66
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,128
I wanted...

67
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,746
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

68
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,673
I always knew
something would become of you.

69
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,830
-Oh, Helge.
-And I have...

70
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,670
A present for you.

71
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,785
It's a book.

72
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,543
Thanks.

73
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,166
Well, I'm running late.
I have to get going.

74
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,038
We're all behind you, Cl...

75
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,956
I came just before six to feed the animals
and found this.

76
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,075
Maybe a wolf?

77
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,291
No bite marks. Nothing.

78
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,785
Poisoned?

79
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,081
Yesterday they were lively as can be.

80
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,666
First the thing with the boy,
and now this.

81
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,790
Such things didn't use to happen here.

82
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,666
Who would just kill 33 sheep?

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,830
"Be on guard! Be alert!

84
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,543
You do not know
when that time will come."

85
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,876
The Gospel of Mark, 13:33.

86
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,211
Didn't know you were a churchgoer.

87
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,713
The parish has a new priest.
A good man.

88
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,415
Mrs. Tiedemann.

89
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,753
Mrs. Tiedemann,

90
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,253
Tronte Nielsen from the paper is here,
for the interview.

91
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,381
And here are the figures
from 1986 and 1985, as you requested.

92
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,131
They weren't easy to get a hold of.

93
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,460
And congratulations again.

94
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,826
I still can't believe
we have a woman as boss.

95
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,503
Are you sure these are the right figures?

96
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,673
Yes.

97
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,001
REPORT:
33 DEAD SHEEP

98
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,786
What are you doing here?

99
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,833
I...

100
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,003
I'm looking for my dad.

101
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,711
What's his name?

102
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,083
Ulrich Nielsen.

103
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,540
Ulrich Nielsen? The Ulrich Nielsen?

104
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,961
-Doesn't he work here?
-No.

105
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,631
And I'm certain he never will.

106
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,456
Oh, so this is a joke?
Was this Ulrich's dumb idea?

107
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,625
Did he do this?

108
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,293
Did Ulrich do this?

109
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,673
-What's your name?
-Mikkel.

110
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,581
-Last name?
-Nielsen.

111
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,130
I'm Ulrich's son.

112
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,168
Now tell me your parents' real names

113
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,170
and I'll take you home.

114
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,883
What's the date?

115
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,998
5th of November.

116
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,878
What year?

117
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,501
1986.

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,880
1986.

119
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,788
Tiedemann.

120
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
I have an injured boy here.

121
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,536
Can one of you come pick him up?

122
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,420
Thanks.

123
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:37,126
Someone will be coming
to pick you up and take care of that.

124
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,418
In the meantime I'll take care of Ulrich.

125
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,206
He won't hurt you again.

126
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,076
I promise.

127
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,456
An interview? Are you serious, Tronte?

128
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,286
People are interested.

129
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,333
A woman taking charge
of the nuclear power plant.

130
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,576
That's progressive, even for the '80s.

131
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:35,206
I have no time for this today.
Make a new appointment with my secretary.

132
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,083
Hey!

133
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,878
I miss you.

134
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,288
I thought we talked about this.

135
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,036
You can't just leave me hanging like this.

136
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,455
Claudia, I need you!

137
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,333
I'm going stir crazy at home.

138
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,330
-Jana loses it more and more and I...
-I want you to go now.

139
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,133
Tonight?

140
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,376
Please.

141
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,415
Maybe.

142
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,540
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

143
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,575
Please call information.

144
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,583
MISSING PERSON'S REPORT
MADS NIELSEN

145
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,078
WINDEN BOY (12)
VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE

146
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,916
MADS NIELSEN (12) MISSING
SINCE LAST WEEK

147
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,378
Hello.

148
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,706
I'm Nurse Ines.

149
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,331
But you can just call me Ines.

150
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,665
I'll take you to the hospital now.

151
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,880
We'll take a look at your arm, okay?

152
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,746
Then I'll bring you home safe and sound.

153
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,880
Hello?

154
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,711
Hello!

155
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:02,921
Hello?

156
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,001
What are you doing here?

157
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,210
Why do you listen to such stuff?

158
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,535
The boy you sent...

159
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,540
-Do you think that's funny?
-What boy?

160
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,998
Don't think you'll get away with this.

161
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,125
-Have we been drinking again?
-Beg your pardon?

162
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,705
-I asked if you've been drinking again?
-Who do you think you are?

163
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,825
I want us to find your brother
as badly as you do.

164
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,463
-What's this?
-A hoof. That's obvious.

165
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,995
-Did you do that on the pasture?
-What pasture?

166
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,713
Did you kill the sheep?

167
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,001
If you'd stop drinking your brain to mush,

168
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,628
then Mads might be back by now.

169
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,291
Mr. Tiedemann?

170
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,631
-The door was open.
-Because of Mads.

171
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,711
He forgot his key.

172
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,001
Chief Inspector Tiedemann
wants to update you on the investigation.

173
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,001
They've got new findings.

174
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,461
Exactly. You have nothing.

175
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,876
Now kindly piss off!

176
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,706
Everything's in working order.

177
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,253
How did this happen?

178
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,378
And you still won't tell us your name?

179
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,881
Nurse Ines will bandage you up, okay?

180
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,958
Then you can go back home.

181
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,631
RECORD OF PATIENT ADMISSION

182
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
Don't cry.

183
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,666
Don't cry. Everything will be okay.

184
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,875
Bernd? I have to talk to you.

185
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,291
Were you trying to slip this past me?

186
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,038
I said I need to know
if there are skeletons in the closet.

187
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:51,206
There are things that are worth knowing
and things worth not knowing,

188
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,751
because you can't change them anyway.

189
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,245
What is this?

190
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,633
These are nothing like
the reported figures. Here.

191
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,416
And here.

192
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,038
Everywhere.
It's been like that for three months now.

193
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,961
Do you know
what has changed since Chernobyl?

194
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,461
People have lost faith.
In us, in nuclear power.

195
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,248
They saw the images.

196
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,083
And they can't
get them out of their heads.

197
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:28,125
But fear is the worst enemy of progress.

198
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,038
So?

199
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,538
How many people around here
rely on this plant for their livelihood?

200
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,745
-We have 612 employees, excluding...
-Everyone!

201
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,286
And when you take over this job tomorrow,

202
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,535
you'll be taking on responsibility
for the nuclear power plant,

203
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,915
but you'll also be taking responsibility
for the entire town.

204
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,205
And now tell me
I wasn't wrong about you.

205
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,883
All the more reason
for me to know just what this means.

206
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,286
And? Everything A-okay with your daughter?

207
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,501
Yes, everything's A-okay.

208
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,878
It's a big deal.

209
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,956
A woman taking charge of the power plant.

210
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,036
Sure it is.

211
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,286
-And your granddaughter?
-Regina?

212
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,630
She's good too.

213
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,038
So were they poisoned?

214
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,671
Hardly.

215
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,211
All signs point to sudden cardiac arrest.

216
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,333
-Cardiac arrest?
-Yes.

217
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,916
All 33?

218
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,460
It's common with sheep.
They're very sensitive creatures.

219
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,753
If a few start to panic,

220
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,963
the entire herd freaks out.

221
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,171
It's a vicious cycle.
They just drop dead.

222
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,670
Like flies.

223
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,923
-And what could cause such a panic?
-All kinds of things.

224
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,173
A person?

225
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,790
A single person?

226
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:50,626
Unless he's Freddy Krueger,
he'd have his work cut out for him.

227
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,668
Was one of the sheep...

228
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,826
I mean, was one of them missing a hoof?

229
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:03,828
No.

230
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,535
They're all as God created them.

231
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,538
Do you know anything about Satanists?

232
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,793
You think Satanists did this?

233
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,710
As far as I know,
they make a big show of it all.

234
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,791
You'd find traces on the pasture.

235
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,000
Very strange.

236
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,750
Look here.

237
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,330
The eardrums are ruptured.

238
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,126
On both sides.

239
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,670
Strange.

240
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:44,541
Coming to our party this weekend?
My wife's making Yugoslavian meatballs.

241
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,745
Spicy as hell, but also tasty as hell.

242
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,880
What we know is a drop,

243
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,168
what we don't know

244
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,251
is an ocean.

245
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,918
Won't you tell me
your name and where you live?

246
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,165
Don't you want to go home?

247
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:41,166
If something happened at home...

248
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,131
you can stay here for now.

249
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,003
If you want to talk, I'm here.

250
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,916
I'm on the night shift too.

251
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,035
Here, something to read.

252
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,745
I come from the future.

253
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,918
What did you say?

254
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,036
I come from the future.

255
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,285
Mom?

256
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,668
Hi, it's Mom.

257
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,130
If you're hearing this, heat up a pizza.

258
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:49,208
I'm coming later.
I have something to take care of.

259
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,131
-Hey, Hannah!
-Hey, Ulrich.

260
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,751
Is this the Apocalypse?

261
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,541
A bit disappointing.

262
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,673
I imagined it being louder.

263
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,710
More glaring.

264
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,883
If the world ended today,

265
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,248
and everything started anew,

266
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,205
what would you wish for?

267
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,461
Easy.

268
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:15,996
A world without Winden.

269
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,210
To a world without Winden.

270
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,125
To a world without Winden.

271
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,540
I don't think Winden
is going to give up that easily.

272
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,460
Well, maybe next time.

273
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,673
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

274
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,576
Hello?

275
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,333
Hello!

276
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,208
Help!

277
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:20,996
Help!

278
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:32,881
Hello?

279
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:53,705
Hello?

280
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:55,786
Anybody there?

281
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:58,923
Mikkel?

282
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,998
Mikkel?

283
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:08,541
