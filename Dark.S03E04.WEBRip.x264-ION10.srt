00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,130
THE ORIGIN

2
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,083
We're attracted to the dark
like moths to light.

3
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,830
We are born out of the darkness

4
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,826
and we return to it.

5
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,246
You've grown, Tronte.

6
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,131
Do we know each other?

7
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,710
I knew your mother.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,830
But that was a long time ago.

9
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,040
You take after her.

10
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,881
Your eyes.

11
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:49,958
Who are you?

12
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,583
I don't have a name.

13
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,248
I was never given one.

14
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,625
But I chose your name back then.

15
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,383
It belonged to your mother.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,828
I think it should belong to you now.

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,790
I have to go now.

18
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,711
I love you.

19
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,286
I don't know if you'll like it, but...

20
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,040
May I put it on you?

21
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,415
You don't like it?

22
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,001
No, I...

23
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,541
I do, it's very beautiful.

24
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,745
I don't know.

25
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,880
I haven't felt quite right all week.

26
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,578
You look pale.

27
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,248
Maybe you should see a doctor.

28
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,415
Will I see you later?

29
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,418
I... I don't know. It's...

30
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,173
I think it's best if I stay home tonight.

31
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,333
Katharina...

32
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,625
I'm glad you decided to stay here.

33
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,130
In Winden.

34
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,995
You're beautiful.

SENSATIONAL NUDE PHOTOS

37
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,420
Her facial expression...

38
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,330
KESS
THE EXHILARATING MAGAZINE

39
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,786
Where did you get it?

40
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,078
-I found it in my dad's stuff.
-Ines, Claudia.Â We're already late.

41
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,710
My dad says you don't learn
anything in school.

42
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,375
You only learn from life.

43
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,828
Why don't they have these with men?

44
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,291
-I don't think it's fair at all.
-You're crazy.

45
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,376
Have you ever seen one?

46
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,825
-I mean, that's not your dad's?
-Ines!

47
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,538
Jana, don't be like that.

48
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,963
And what did it look like?

49
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,171
Peculiar.

50
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,126
As if it didn't belong to the rest of him.

51
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,626
Tronte?

52
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,630
I think he's a strange boy.

53
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,535
Is his mother back?

54
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,536
It's odd. Don't you think?

55
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,826
To just disappear like that?

56
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,331
POLICE

57
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,420
Doris.

58
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,920
What are you doing here?

59
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,881
I want to talk to you.
Mr. Kahnwald let me in.

60
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,920
Where have you been?
I thought you left early to write reports.

61
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
It...

62
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,076
I...

63
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,001
Something came up.

64
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,876
This morning...

65
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
I did the laundry and I found something.

66
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,496
Here.

67
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,001
It was between one of her blouses.
I thought it might help out.

68
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,878
She said her husband was a man of God.

69
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,290
And maybe it's just a coincidence, but...

70
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,075
the minister who disappeared
at the same time...

71
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,415
His name is Hanno Tauber.

72
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,328
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER
HANNO TAUBER (42) FROM VECHTA

73
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,246
I...

74
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
I thought her husband was dead.

75
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,750
It's been three months.

76
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,328
You don't just leave your child behind
without a word.

77
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,705
You should go home.
We're taking care of it.

78
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,631
Egon! I know something happened.

79
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,248
Why would she leave all this behind?

80
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,166
Who knows what goes on inside
the heads of you women?

81
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,131
Doris!

82
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,325
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26, 1954
MRS. AGNES NIELSEN

83
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,916
HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS WOMAN?

84
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,628
You chose the right side.

85
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,955
Don't forget that.

86
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,078
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

87
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,126
You have to give this to Claudia.

88
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,541
When it's time.

89
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,170
Life is a gift...

90
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,503
for those who know how to use it.

91
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,705
Are you going to tell Martha?

92
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,833
What the origin really is?

93
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,000
All of these years, I've wondered...

94
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,878
why you ditched us in 1888.

95
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,381
Why you helped us create the matter...

96
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,040
and then simply disappeared.

97
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,630
Who would've thought that 33 years later

98
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,958
it would be us who gave you the order.

99
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,246
Magnus...

100
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,461
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,331
It doesn't matter anymore.

102
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,418
Adam is waiting for us.

103
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,825
NOVEMBER 6, 2052

104
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,746
This is your future.

105
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,625
Thirty-three years away
from your yesterday.

106
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,291
The door in the cave...

107
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,326
What is that?

108
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,378
It is a path
that connects past and future.

109
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,455
Why are these names crossed out?

110
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,581
It means they die.

111
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,076
All of them.

112
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,128
-What do you mean, they all die?
-In two days.

113
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,463
The apocalypse in his world

114
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,923
also happens in ours.

115
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,575
This isn't real.

116
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,960
You're not real.

117
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,710
This is your future.

118
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,326
If you...

119
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,956
If the both of you fail
to stop the apocalypse.

120
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,538
So you haven't been in Winden long?

121
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,535
Three months.

122
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,211
I like it here.

123
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,825
It's much less complicated
than where I'm from.

124
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,713
Well, maybe that's about to change.

125
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,375
You're pregnant.

126
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,628
At your age,
a pregnancy is not without risks.

127
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,078
You should take care of yourself.
No hard work.

128
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,706
That's impossible.

129
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:39,995
Listen.

130
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,580
Some gifts come into our lives
unexpectedly.

131
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,325
Yet they're still gifts.

132
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,458
Mrs. Doppler.

133
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,126
How can I help you?

134
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,583
I'd like to know if there is any news.

135
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,171
I'm afraid...

136
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,173
I'm afraid not.

137
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,075
Unless Helge decides
to tell us where he was...

138
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,076
That is...

139
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,288
whom he was with...

140
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,668
I'm afraid we're stuck.

141
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,670
This isn't about Helge.

142
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,626
This is about the missing minister.

143
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,293
The congregation has been
without support for weeks.

144
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,248
It leaves the door open for the devil.

145
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,166
You knew the man?

146
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,078
The minister?

147
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,631
Did he...

148
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,958
Did you ever see him
in the company of a woman?

149
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,540
What are you thinking?

150
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,708
I want you to find the man.

151
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,375
Hanno Tauber.

152
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,711
Sorry to disturb you.

153
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,458
Are you the new minister?

154
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,378
I once was.

155
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,165
But it's been a long time.

156
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,576
The thing is, I'm looking for someone.

157
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,920
My husband and I,

158
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,081
our daughter is very talented,
and last winter we sublet the guest room

159
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,075
so we could save up money for Claudia,
for when she goes to college.

160
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,996
The woman who moved in with us,

161
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,503
she disappeared, three months ago.

162
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,500
Her husband was a man of God.

163
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,583
She said he died.

164
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,956
I don't know why,
but I got the impression that wasn't true.

165
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,131
And the man who was the minister here
disappeared at the same time, so...

166
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,883
What if he was her husband?

167
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,463
And she went back to him?

168
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,578
I don't think she liked him very much.

169
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,500
Not all human connections

170
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,418
are formed out of fondness.

171
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,293
Well, it's about the boy.

172
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,375
He's still with us, and...

173
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,921
a boy needs his mother.

174
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,788
With every lie

175
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,538
the human soul dies just a little bit.

176
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,670
I don't understand.

177
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're not interested in the boy.

178
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,580
You're interested in the woman.

179
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,293
I think you've misunderstood me.

180
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,375
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

181
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,535
It does what it wants.

182
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,878
Just ask your husband.

183
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,581
He'll tell you the same thing.

184
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,668
My husband?

185
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,705
Haven't you wondered why he's been leaving
the house so early lately?

186
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,711
Why he's been working so late?

187
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,415
Couldn't the reason be another woman?

188
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,415
It's difficult for us to let go...

189
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,793
of what we desire deep within ourselves.

190
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,921
Hello, Tronte.

191
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,631
Hello.

192
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,541
What's that?

193
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,711
It's so beautiful.

194
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,000
Why weren't you at school today?

195
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,826
What are you doing here?

196
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,875
I like it here.

197
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,290
It's so...

198
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,206
desolate.

199
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,456
I like to write, you know.

200
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,788
Stories.

201
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,250
You have a nice smile.

202
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:22,081
POLICE

203
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,501
What are you doing here?

204
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,960
You can't just show up here.

205
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,208
What if someone sees you?

206
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,576
Is everything okay?

207
00:23:58,791 --> 00:23:59,831
I'm pregnant.

208
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,541
I thought you were being careful.

209
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,211
Is it mine?

210
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,996
Is it yours?

211
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,538
What do you think I do all day long?
Fuck around?

212
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,418
Do you think I chose this?

213
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,420
Living in this shithole?

214
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,583
I thought you were harmless,
but you're all the same.

215
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,038
You all think you own the world.
That you can take what you want.

216
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,665
You eat and fuck and think you're God.

217
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:21,418
Everywhere you go,
always the same fucking smug assholes.

218
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,830
Katharina,
you don't know what you're saying.

219
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,878
It's best if I drive you home now.

220
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,415
The coal industry has him wrapped around
its little finger.

221
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,673
I don't care how long it takes!

222
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,170
We'll submit
another building permit request.

223
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:05,706
Nuclear power is the future.
And the future cannot be stopped.

224
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,133
I don't care what the mayor says!

225
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,245
Oh, Claudia.

226
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,173
Look at you.

227
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,331
You're all grown up.

228
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,788
A real lady.

229
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,750
Pretty and smart as a whip.

230
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,418
Helge will be pleased to see you.

231
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,920
And, of course,
you'll be rewarded for your services.

232
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,213
But that's far too much.

233
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,503
Let me give you some advice.
A life lesson.

234
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,628
If you really want something,

235
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,958
then take it.

236
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,960
Things don't just happen by themselves.

237
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you.

238
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,748
NUCLEAR POWER AND PEACE

239
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,708
TOWN HALL

240
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,498
Is Heinz sick, or...

241
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,173
What do you want?

242
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,131
How much money
did the coal industry pay you

243
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,708
to block the plans
for the nuclear power plant?

244
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,833
I have no idea what you're talking about.

245
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,416
So Doppler sent you, right?

246
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,131
Do you know what money can't buy?

247
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,536
The future.

248
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,458
More precisely, your future.

249
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,041
We think we're immortal,

250
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,920
but, in truth, often only one breath...

251
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,083
separates the now from the hereafter.

252
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,916
What do you want from me?

253
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:09,878
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

254
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,250
BUILDING PERMIT

255
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:16,166
The building permit
for the nuclear power plant, it's...

256
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,211
To the future.

257
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,580
You can change it.

258
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,326
Both of you can change it.

259
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:36,036
The barrels at the nuclear plant,
they trigger the apocalypse.

260
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,711
You have to stop them from being opened.

261
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,205
What do we do then?

262
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:46,081
Eva said there's a way to undo this knot.

263
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,626
That there's a way Martha can live.
My Martha!

264
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,330
She lied to you.

265
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,825
There is no way to save both worlds.

266
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,996
You have to choose one of them.

267
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,125
The apocalypse, in two days...

268
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,251
it can be stopped.

269
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,751
You two can stop it.

270
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,786
They can live. All of them.

271
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,328
Mikkel...

272
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,208
can live.

273
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,420
Isn't that what you wanted?

274
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,875
But, in return, you have to let her go.

275
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,421
Your Martha.

276
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,333
Your world.

277
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,000
You've seen what becomes of you there.

278
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,131
What you'll do.

279
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,210
What Adam will do.

280
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,248
You're both out of your minds.

281
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,706
I'm going home now,
and I'll wake up in my bed

282
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,081
and all of this will have been
just a crappy dream.

283
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,330
Jonas, this is exactly what you wanted.

284
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,083
You and Martha.

285
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,630
In this world,
the two of you are not impossible.

286
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,328
Martha!

287
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,673
Wait!

288
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,580
Hey.

289
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:26,881
Hey.

290
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,075
You believe all of this?

291
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,165
That they're all going to die?

292
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,670
That's crazy.

293
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,540
I'm crazy. This is...

294
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,078
Believe me, I know exactly how it feels.

295
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,960
It's all true?

296
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,043
Everything she said is true?

297
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,711
But I know there's a way.

298
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,830
A way to straighten all this out again.

299
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,248
And I'm not going to stop
looking for that way.

300
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,170
I think that's what she's doing too.

301
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,076
The Martha who brought me here.

302
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,963
It's time.

303
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,710
So you have no idea where your mom is?

304
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,630
And the man this morning...

305
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:27,041
You think that may have been your dad?

306
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,710
My mother didn't talk about him much.

307
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,920
She said...

308
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,290
he's a bad person.

309
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,326
I was in a home for a long time.

310
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,293
What's it like in a home?

311
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,165
Can you keep a secret?

312
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,380
That man this morning...

313
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,291
I don't even want to know if he's my dad.

314
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,213
And I'm glad that my mother's gone.

315
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,288
You can have it if you want.

316
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,748
Jana?

317
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,326
What are you doing here?

318
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,380
Didn't you go home hours ago?

319
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,166
We're already late.
I'm sure Mom is waiting with dinner.

320
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,130
See you around.

321
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,628
Maybe see you tomorrow.

322
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,876
What do we do now?

323
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,995
Don't worry. I don't want to keep it.

324
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,130
Why do some people have everything?

325
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,131
And others nothing?

326
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,496
Hm?

327
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:39,576
Why does destiny preordain all that's good
for some and not for others?

328
00:36:56,875 --> 00:37:00,375
All my life I've been trying to hold
onto things you can't hold onto.

329
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,420
But now I finally understand.

330
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,075
I don't need anyone.

331
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,878
None of you.

332
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,920
It's best you go now.

333
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,038
Last year...

334
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,666
Daniel told me about it.

335
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,248
She does it properly.

336
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,213
MRS. OBENDORF

337
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,883
I'm sorry.

338
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,746
You sent them off?

339
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,000
The beginning is the end.

340
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,833
And the end is the beginning.

341
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,125
We are all born of him.

342
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,666
You gave him life.

343
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,915
And he will give us ours.

344
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,173
Him.

345
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,076
Agnes.

346
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,503
Tronte.

347
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,205
Jana.

348
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:14,786
Ulrich.

349
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,420
Katharina.

350
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,038
You.

351
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,168
A line without a beginning or an end.

352
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,881
An infinite circle.

353
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,540
Doris?

354
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:58,711
Is everything okay?

355
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:41,455
I...

356
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,543
I wanted to apologize.

357
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,171
For this morning.

358
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,788
I know you just wanted to help.

359
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,826
Lately, I...

360
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,211
I haven't really been myself.

361
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:09,923
Work and...

362
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,583
I'm sorry.

363
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,665
I know what you've been up to.

364
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,630
With that woman.

365
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,791
What do you mean?

366
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,578
I want a divorce.

367
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,536
What are you talking about?

368
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,710
We should have done it sooner, but I...
I thought...

369
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,785
I don't know what I thought.

370
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,246
All these secrets.

371
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,711
I don't want to live like this.

372
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:03,673
I...

373
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,075
I can explain it to you.

374
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

375
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,498
It does what it wants.

376
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:41,881
Hello.

377
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,538
I... I'm here to see Mrs. Obendorf.

378
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,376
You have to wait.

379
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,290
My mother says...

380
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,705
they go to hell.

381
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,251
The...

382
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,713
The ones that are gotten rid of.

383
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,826
I don't believe in hell.

384
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,961
Hell is what we make for ourselves
on Earth.

385
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,130
I'm Helene.

386
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,330
Helene Albers.

387
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,665
Katharina.

388
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,043
That's a very beautiful name.

389
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,960
St. Christopher!

390
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,995
A nice thought.

391
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:35,043
Someone carrying us on our journey.

392
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,830
Someone watching over us.

393
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,750
Come on now.

394
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,333
Hello, Dad.

395
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:11,916
Where's Mom?

396
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,583
The ways of the heart cannot be explained.

397
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,495
It does what it wants.

398
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,788
Come on.

399
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,173
Leave him.

400
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,575
WINDEN BUILDING AUTHORITY

401
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,831
BUILDING PERMIT

402
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,038
You promised me something.

403
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,708
I kept my end of the agreement.

404
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,963
Now you have to keep yours.

405
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,706
You want to know where the origin is.

406
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,461
And how to destroy it.

407
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,416
You will.

408
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,043
It took me over 66 years

409
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:39,328
to finally understand
how everything is connected.

410
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,168
You're right.

411
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,578
It's time you understood, too.

412
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,166
At school...

413
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,380
when you came through the door, I...

414
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,125
I had this feeling.

415
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,625
As if we knew each other.

416
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,423
From a dream.

417
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,880
Or...

418
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,791
I'm sorry.

419
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,291
About it all.

420
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,961
Where you're from...

421
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,210
What was I like there?

422
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,333
Was I different?

423
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:22,501
I AM LEFT TO DIE ALONE,
AND I AM MY SOLE JUDGE. ME.

424
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:37,576
THE BEGINNING IS THE END.
AND THE END IS THE BEGINNING.

425
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,291
Why are we here?

426
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:33,751
Because this...

427
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:36,876
is where everything began.

428
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,208
In your world.

429
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,333
What does that mean?

430
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,705
Your older self.

431
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,211
She sent you and Jonas back

432
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,673
for a single purpose.

433
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:15,998
You were never meant
to stop the apocalypse.

434
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,418
You were to create the origin.

435
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,333
This is the origin.

436
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,285
What's growing inside you

437
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,708
is the bridge between both worlds.

438
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:47,791
It can't be.

439
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,375
It is the beginning of the knot

440
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,628
and it will be its end.

441
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,208
Your son.

442
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,503
He is the origin.

443
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:34,583
