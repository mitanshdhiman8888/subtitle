00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,875
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PAST,
PRESENT AND FUTURE

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,920
IS ONLY A STUBBORNLY
PERSISTENT ILLUSION. ALBERT EINSTEIN

3
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:30,418
We trust that time is linear.

4
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:38,126
That it proceeds eternally, uniformly.

5
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,503
Into infinity.

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:49,831
But the distinction between past, present

7
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,666
and future

8
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,828
is nothing but an illusion.

9
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:02,791
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
are not consecutive,

10
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:09,126
they are connected
in a never-ending circle.

11
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,705
Everything is connected.

12
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,748
JUNE 21, 2019

13
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,825
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

14
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:44,326
SECRETS

15
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,383
NOVEMBER 4, 2019

16
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,830
Fuck.

17
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,420
Mom.

18
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,043
Mom!

19
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,133
You'd think by 16,
they'd know how to make toast.

20
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,171
Mom!

21
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,080
The power's out again.

22
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,581
Mom!

23
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,375
Thanks for breakfast.

24
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,916
Coming to the meeting tonight?

25
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,831
I don't know.

26
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,915
-Katharina will be there.
-And I'll be there.

27
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,673
Yes, you'll be there.

28
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,210
That's right.

29
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,831
Ulrich.

30
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,750
I love you.

31
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,578
You're beautiful.

32
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,791
MISSING

33
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,130
WINDEN CAVES 0.6 MILES

34
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,705
How was it?

35
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,250
How have you been these last two months?

36
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,921
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want.

37
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,673
I read the notes
from your therapy sessions.

38
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,495
You did pretty good,
especially in the group sessions .

39
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,458
I still see him.

40
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,041
In your dreams?

41
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,878
Why do you think you see him?

42
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,955
As my therapist, shouldn't you tell me?

43
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,541
Are you taking your meds?

44
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,791
I think he's trying to tell me something.

45
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,501
Or maybe I just want him
to tell me something.

46
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,293
What do you think that might be?

47
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,878
What do I think it might be?

48
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,538
Why?

49
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,831
Why he left?

50
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,078
Why like that?

51
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,168
Why he fucking hanged himself?

52
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,330
And why he didn't leave a word?

53
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,576
Nothing to explain this fucking crap!

54
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,333
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

55
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,541
The Winden nuclear power plant
has a long history.

56
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,625
Plans to erect the nuclear power plant
go back as far as 1953.

57
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,328
Construction was first authorized in 1960
after the Atomic Energy Act was passed.

58
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:13,876
As part of the government's staggered plan
to phase out nuclear energy,

59
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,998
the Winden power plant
will be taken off the grid in 2020,

60
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,963
making it one of Germany's power plants
with the longest failure-free operation.

61
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,248
Mikkel,
you're not going to school like that.

62
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,503
A good magician needs a distinctive style.

63
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,583
Change your clothes. Thank you.

64
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,456
These are my work clothes.

65
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,496
And school sucks!

66
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,793
I'm sure the great Hodini went to school.

67
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375
-Houdini! It's not that hard!
-Come have breakfast.

68
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,458
-The greatest magician ever.
-Are you sure he's not adopted?

69
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,331
-And his name is Houdini!
-Same crap every morning.

70
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,246
Mom, where's my black hoodie?

71
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,213
I don't know. Maybe with the jackets.

72
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,171
Magnus, stop trampling like that!

73
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,080
-Morning, Mikkel.
-Good morning.

74
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,326
Ulrich! Why did it take so long?

75
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,456
First day of school.
A huge line at the bakery.

76
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,326
The Apocalypse is upon us.
You coming to eat?

77
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,036
It's not with the jackets.

78
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,285
Ouch!

79
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,375
-Then maybe it's in your gym bag.
-What's going on here now? Magnus?

80
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,131
-Breakfast.
-Mom, I'm on hunger strike.

81
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,918
I won't stuff my face as long as a child
starves to death every ten seconds.

82
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,171
I will.

83
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,751
The damn hoodie isn't in the bag.

84
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,538
-Did you steal my hoodie?
-No, I did not!

85
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,205
-Can't you stop arguing for once?
-Mom, I didn't do anything.

86
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,633
-Where can it be?
-Can I please have my lines back?

87
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,293
Magnus, maybe it's up in the laundry.

88
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,455
Martha, starving won't help anyone.

89
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,171
Mikkel, get changed now. Last warning!

90
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,670
-Or we'll be late.
-Whose idea was it to have kids?

91
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,500
-Can you please open this?
-You're in the way!

92
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291
Did you understand me?

93
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,173
All right then, Houdini.

94
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,923
One last trick, then off to school.

95
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,581
Fine, then everyone can do as they wish.

96
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,288
Found it!

97
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:13,881
Okay.

98
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,785
There...

99
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,380
and there.

100
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,671
Amazing! How did you do that?

101
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,080
Dad, the question isn't how,

102
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,213
the question is when.

103
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,670
Hey!

104
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,668
Welcome back to the madhouse.

105
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,580
It was damn boring without you here.

106
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,000
-Hey, what the hell are you staring at?
-What a freak.

107
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,830
What idiots.

108
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you tell anyone?

109
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,828
I told everyone you were
on a two-month school exchange in France,

110
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,076
playing hide-the-baguette.

111
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,170
Relax. Come on.

112
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,290
It'll be fine. Let's go.

113
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,205
Come on.

114
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,631
-What about here?
-You didn't miss much.

115
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,538
Except for the thing with Erik.

116
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,665
You don't give a shit!

117
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,040
Why is nobody doing anything?
Where is our son? Where is Erik?

118
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,793
Mr. Obendorf.

119
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,880
No one is unimportant to us here.
We've done 172 interviews.

120
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,498
We've questioned neighbors and friends,
combed the entire forest,

121
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,383
searched the houses and basements
of nearby residents.

122
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,578
23 officers and over 50 volunteers

123
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,626
have been searching for your son for days.

124
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,788
We're doing our job.
And we'll do it better if you calm down.

125
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,165
-You're not doing shit!
-Hey!

126
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,288
Calm down!
Stop. Calm down now.

127
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Hey! Come now.

128
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,793
Listen.

129
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,540
We can't rule out the possibility
that no crime has been committed.

130
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,915
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Maybe Erik left voluntarily.

131
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,251
He's done it before.

132
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,423
But when he ran away,
he always came back after two days.

133
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,000
-He'd sleep in the basement or wherever.
-It's been 13 days.

134
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,876
It's been 13 days now.

135
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,208
We'll find your son, I promise.

136
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,828
Now go home. Okay?

137
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,626
Go home.

138
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458
Franziska.

139
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,080
Magnus.

140
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,383
Shouldn't you be with the geeks?

141
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,543
Should the principal's son
be smoking a joint on school grounds?

142
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,080
Especially such bad weed.

143
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,748
Assemblies like this are for idiots.
They need to get rid of them.

144
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,293
Maybe you did miss something.

145
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,131
Hey.

146
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,038
Hey.

147
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,790
How was France?

148
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,210
French. How else?

149
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,918
What a nice welcome. Thank you.

150
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,376
The reason I've asked you
to assemble here before class

151
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,038
is because I wanted to talk to you
about something important.

152
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,920
About Erik Obendorf.

153
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,753
You all know Erik has been missing
for almost two weeks now.

154
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,576
I want to tell you
that if you need to talk to someone,

155
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,666
if you have questions or if you know
anything about Erik's disappearance,

156
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,420
you can come to us at any time.

157
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,380
Come to us, talk to us.

158
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,788
There can be no secrets in this matter.

159
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,875
Okay?

160
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,423
No one saw him after practice.
Not a trace, nothing.

161
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,171
-As if he vanished into thin air.
-Maybe he just doesn't want to be found.

162
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,630
The money under the bed? His phone?
You'd take that if you were running away.

163
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,041
Sometimes people just want to get away.

164
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,421
49 tire tracks on the road between
the school and the residential area.

165
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,710
Two of them are from trucks.

166
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,881
There are 21,312 vehicles registered
in the district of Winden alone.

167
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,961
-That's all we have.
-So we've got nothing at all.

168
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,833
Erik's father drives a van.

169
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,133
You don't think he's involved.

170
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,083
Why are you so certain Erik ran away?

171
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,126
This is Winden.

172
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,788
-Nothing ever happens here.
-But that hasn't always been the case.

173
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,003
This has nothing to do with my brother.

174
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,331
Not a thing.

175
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,536
Oh, your mother called
the emergency number again this morning.

176
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,961
Maybe you should pay her a visit.

177
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,168
Do you ever wonder
where you took a wrong turn?

178
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,628
Where your life became the exact opposite
of what you always wanted it to be?

179
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,793
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

180
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,920
Hotel Winden. Regina Tiedemann speaking.
How can I help you?

181
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,291
I see, but surely
there's something we can do.

182
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,245
Temporarily suspend
the loan repayments, for example.

183
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,876
Just a slight deferment of payments
until things have calmed down again here.

184
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,915
I have not miscalculated.
Are you even listening to me?

185
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,790
Who wants to go on vacation in a town
where a child has disappeared?

186
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,375
Would you want that?

187
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,828
I have a family suite available.

188
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,076
A weekend with the little ones?
They'd love it, wouldn't they?

189
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,666
You bankers sit on your piles of money
and think you can bully people.

190
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,880
I've built up a business here.
By myself. Without any help.

191
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,668
My husband and I have been
customers of your bank for 20 years!

192
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,960
And now you're pulling this?
You stupid asshole!

193
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,131
I want to speak to your supervisor.

194
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,455
Hello?

195
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,463
Hello?

196
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,578
Shit, shit, shit!

197
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,883
A black hole forms

198
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,918
when the center of a star collapses
into itself after a supernova explosion.

199
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,791
Even new neutron matter
cannot prevent the collapse.

200
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,375
You know
what I've been wondering for days?

201
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,168
If the blackest hole of all
is parked in Franziska Doppler's ass.

202
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,128
But, seriously,
what I really wonder is this:

203
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,208
If Erik didn't run away,
but got snuffed out or something instead,

204
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,461
then all his dope is still in the caves.

205
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,828
He kept his entire stash there.

206
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,791
-So?
-Oh, man!

207
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,325
We go in there and... bingo!

208
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,041
-That's bullshit.
-It's awesome.

209
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,291
You haven't been here in a long time.

210
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,416
Where's Dad?

211
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,625
You could come by more often.

212
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,458
Mom, if you want me to stop by
then call me, not the emergency number.

213
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958
I saw something in the forest again.

214
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,001
This time very clearly.

215
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,003
A dark figure with a gigantic head.

216
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,833
Mom.

217
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,208
You don't believe me.

218
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,326
There are things out there
that our little minds

219
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,580
will never comprehend.

220
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,461
And I found this in the forest.

221
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,208
Mads loved those.

222
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,875
This business with that missing Erik...

223
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,918
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

224
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,040
...like with your brother, back then.

225
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,745
Everything's repeating itself.

226
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,790
Everything is just like it was
33 years ago.

227
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,791
REST HOME WINDEN

228
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,671
It's going to happen again.

229
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,998
It's going to happen again.

230
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,208
It's going to happen again.

231
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,830
Bullshit.
Then you'll go around selling it or what?

232
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,996
No, dude.
We'll smoke half of it ourselves.

233
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,333
And if there are capacities on the market,
you don't hesitate.

234
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,496
We'll go there and get the stuff.

235
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,043
Easy peasy.

236
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,040
Who's getting what stuff?

237
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,075
We're going to the caves tonight.

238
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,793
-You turning into boy scouts?
-Bartosz thinks Erik's dope is there.

239
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,133
Fanny told me they once found
a dead squirrel with five legs there.

240
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,038
You'll believe any old crap.

241
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,706
Just because you can't see past your nose

242
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,671
doesn't mean
there aren't things going on out there

243
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,920
that the nuclear power mafia
keeps secret from the public.

244
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,631
Don't forget to breathe.

245
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,668
Franziska.

246
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,213
Magnus.

247
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,416
-You got a crush on her now or what?
-Shut up.

248
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,920
-Hey, idiot.
-Okay, what the hell.

249
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,791
-Let's go to the caves tonight and look.
-Yeah, dude!

250
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,538
Come on.

251
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,673
Can't even hold out half a day?

252
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,671
Impossible. I'm dying.

253
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,461
You coming later?

254
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,706
I don't know.

255
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,631
Everyone will be there.

256
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,128
Gawking at me.

257
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,960
I'll be in Frankfurt this weekend
for training, staying in a hotel.

258
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,631
And...

259
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,040
-Um... Yeah, I thought...
-You thought?

260
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,500
Don't think too long,

261
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,213
I have various candidates.

262
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,745
-See you later.
- Maybe.

263
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Yes, right there.

264
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,003
It's totally knotted up.

265
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,668
It's supposed to rain later.

266
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,001
Scars sense that.

267
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,626
They can see into the future, so to speak.

268
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,036
The tissue hardens

269
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,285
and cramps up.

270
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,673
Thanks.

271
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,876
Maybe the whole thing
is getting to me more than I thought.

272
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,251
In a year, everything here
is meant to come to an end.

273
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,825
Nearly 33 years ago to the day
when I came to Winden.

274
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,710
I never thought it would end like this.

275
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,330
But there's a time for everything.

276
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,918
Yes.

277
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,290
There's a time for everything.

278
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,633
I'm sorry. About the thing with Michael.

279
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,170
How are you doing? How's Jonas?

280
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,036
Good.

281
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,503
We're good.

282
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,583
It's Hannah here. The power's out again.

283
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,076
I mean, if you want us out of the house,
then just say so.

284
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,376
Your grandson
hasn't seen you in over three months.

285
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,078
Do you think Michael wanted that?

286
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,536
That's sick.

287
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,035
You're sick.

288
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:24,081
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

289
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,420
Hannah!

290
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
How nice.

291
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,035
We haven't seen each other for ages.

292
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,881
How are you?

293
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,496
Okay.

294
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,328
Yeah, well, you know... I'm okay.

295
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,671
Good.

296
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,375
Go inside. I'll be right in, okay?

297
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,333
Hi.

298
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,081
Hi.

299
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,501
Where are Bartosz and the others?

300
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,633
Late. As always.

301
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,881
-The thing with Bartosz...
-It's okay. You don't need to explain.

302
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,878
But I want to.

303
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,081
I wrote you a text while you were away.

304
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,666
Not just one.

305
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,248
But I never sent them.

306
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:43,001
It all sounded wrong somehow.

307
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,001
What happened between us last summer...

308
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,166
-I...
-It's really okay.

309
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:53,916
Something up?

310
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,915
I think I'm having déjà vu.

311
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,170
The light, the forest.

312
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,495
As if all of this
has already happened before.

313
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,000
A glitch in the matrix.

314
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,496
What?

315
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:15,083
If the world is a simulation,
déjà vu is a glitch in the matrix.

316
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,788
Or a message from the other side.

317
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,960
I read that somewhere.

318
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,081
I'm glad you're back.

319
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,666
-Hey, what the hell?
-Parents' meeting.

320
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,286
Heide's got a stomach bug.
I'm stuck with him.

321
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,455
Hi, Jonas. Ultimate fist bump?

322
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,291
Take him back now.

323
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,245
-You take him back.
-Relax, guys.

324
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,503
I'm not a baby anymore.

325
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,748
What's the idiot doing here?

326
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,916
Only I can do that, okay?

327
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,880
Ouch!

328
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,245
Well, let's go!

329
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,375
It's going to happen again.

330
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,381
It's going to happen again.

331
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,326
It's going to happen again.

332
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,788
You all know that Erik
has been missing for 14 days now.

333
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,253
At this point,
we have no new findings to report.

334
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,325
We're also considering
that he may have simply run away.

335
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:38,455
If any of your children
say anything about Erik or know anything,

336
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,826
please inform us.

337
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,326
-Thank you, Charlotte.
-How long do you want to wait?

338
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,286
I'd like to talk about
how we interact at school.

339
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,040
And about which measures
we can take to boost security.

340
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,035
What kind of measures?

341
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,035
You heard her say it's not clear
that anything even happened.

342
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,330
But we can't rule anything out,
including that Erik didn't run away.

343
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,076
WILL BE OUTSIDE IN 5 MINUTES

344
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,916
This alarmist talk is absurd.

345
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,501
Charlotte, correct me if I'm wrong,
but in the region,

346
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,173
Winden has the lowest crime rate.

347
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,580
There are no murderers
running around here.

348
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:14,376
-Statistics only give...
-But we can't just sit and do nothing.

349
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,668
And just wait around until Erik
is found dead somewhere.

350
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,578
What do you guys think happened to Erik?

351
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,746
Kids in our class
are saying someone kidnapped him,

352
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,253
and has him locked up in a basement.

353
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,213
Oh, shut up. He just ran away.

354
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:40,036
But it could be that he's locked up
somewhere and can't get out.

355
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,826
Why would someone do that?
Lock someone else up?

356
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,206
It's like the witch in Hansel and Gretel.

357
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,501
When she gets hungry,
she has something to eat.

358
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:53,753
No. Even if Mom and Dad tell you
that most people are nice,

359
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,673
there are people out there
who are anything but nice.

360
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,000
-Like your sister.
-You idiot.

361
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,833
My father said good and evil
are a question of perspective.

362
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,381
Dead father, bad topic?

363
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,291
And if Erik is no longer alive?

364
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,785
If he's lying dead somewhere
and no one finds him?

365
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,043
That would be the worst.

366
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,535
Even if you're dead, you want to be found.

367
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,415
No one is dead,
and no one won't be found, okay?

368
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,543
Can we please change the topic now?

369
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,878
The most important thing is
that we stick together.

370
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,538
That we pull together.

371
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,535
The most important thing
is not to blow this out of proportion,

372
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,955
or we'll have the press
in town in a few days.

373
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,081
We know that doesn't quite fit in
with your plans, Regina.

374
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,576
If you mean my hotel,
this isn't about that at all.

375
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,666
-No? What is it about then?
-It's about our town.

376
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,745
Wrong. This is about a missing child.

377
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,923
Who probably just ran away.
You just heard it yourself.

378
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,791
Maybe you should just worry
about your own problems.

379
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,501
I have no idea what you're talking about.

380
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,576
It's going to happen again.

381
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,955
Helge!

382
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,711
-What are you doing here?
-Is it already too late?

383
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:14,923
Helge.

384
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,745
It's me, Charlotte.

385
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,166
I'll take you back now, okay?

386
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,830
It's going to happen again!

387
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,253
I'm bored.

388
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,535
-Can we please go home now?
-Nonsense, we're nearly there.

389
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,166
Jonas!

390
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,131
Come on!

391
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
ATTENTION!

392
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,790
Over there.

393
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,455
In the armchair.

394
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,580
-And?
-Fuck, dude.

395
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,788
-It was here!
-Looking for this?

396
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,786
-What's she doing here?
-That's mine.

397
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,746
The definition of ownership says

398
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:02,213
that possession is nine-tenths of the law,
so it's mine for now.

399
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,461
But I'm selling.
What'll you give me for it?

400
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,541
A kick in the ass.

401
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
What's in here is easily worth 500.

402
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,633
It's yours for 200.
Daddy's got plenty of money.

403
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,498
Stop the bullshit.

404
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,003
Just give it to me.

405
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,461
Jackpot!

406
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,415
What's that?

407
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,461
Someone's there.

408
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,001
Oh, shit!

409
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,423
Holy shit!

410
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,625
Shit.

411
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,958
-Damn flashlight!
-What is this?

412
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,246
What's that?

413
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,633
-Run!
-Move!

414
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,378
-Run!
-Go!

415
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,575
Come on.

416
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,423
Mikkel?

417
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,540
Mikkel!

418
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,418
Jonas.

419
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,671
What the fuck, man! What was that?

420
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,630
No idea. Shit!

421
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,915
Man, what was that?

422
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,791
Where are Jonas and Mikkel?

423
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,205
Where is Mikkel?

424
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,455
Where is Mikkel?

425
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,791
Why isn't he with you?

426
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,415
He was with you!

427
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,753
Shit! Mikkel!

428
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,250
Mikkel!

429
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,536
Too late.

430
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,205
We're too late.

431
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,125
Mikkel!

432
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,498
Mikkel!

433
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,288
Mikkel!

434
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,288
Mikkel!

435
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,628
Mikkel!

436
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,035
Mikkel?

437
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:02,881
Mikkel!

438
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,830
Mikkel!

439
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,455
Do you have anything?

440
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:18,915
Okay.

441
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,705
Yes?

442
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,291
-Have you found him?
-Nothing.

443
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,921
No trace of Mikkel.

444
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,415
-How's Franziska?
-Sleeping.

445
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,036
Charlotte, I...

446
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,915
Can we...

447
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,131
I have to tell you...

448
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,535
Charlotte?

449
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,825
I have to go.

450
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,455
Okay.

451
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,330
Okay.

452
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:04,171
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

453
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,290
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

454
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,998
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

455
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:16,043
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

456
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,288
Calling all units.
At the forest edge at Neuweiher,

457
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,375
elevation F026, two-mile marker,
a child's body has been found.

458
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,128
I repeat, a child's body has been found.

459
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,038
I'm sorry.

460
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,171
That's not Mikkel.

461
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,496
That's not Mikkel.

462
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:47,963
We fall through the time stream
Then awaken from a dream

463
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:56,535
But a brief blink of an eye
And then returns the night

464
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:06,165
Somehow the future starts somewhere
Sometime

465
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,580
I won't wait for long

466
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:14,208
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

467
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,921
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

468
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:09,541
