1
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,916
I remember.

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,420
I remember everything.

3
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,460
CROSSROADS

4
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,670
What are you doing here?

5
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,583
The boy we found in the forest.

6
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,666
What's going to happen to him now?

7
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,420
If you don't figure out who he is

8
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,000
he'll be cremated
and buried in an anonymous grave.

9
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,293
How long has he been dead?

10
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,750
It's all in my report.

11
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,793
When you found him,
ten hours, more or less.

12
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,628
Is it possible that he...

13
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,826
Purely hypothetically,

14
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,665
is it possible he's been dead for longer,
and was somehow preserved?

15
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,170
Preserved?

16
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,540
You mean, like frozen?

17
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,878
If so there would be traces in the tissue.
I would've noticed.

18
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,788
Frozen steak isn't like fresh steak.

19
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,578
-So that's a no.
-Nope. Not that I'm aware of.

20
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,420
How long of a preservation period
are we talking about?

21
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,381
-Thirty-three years.
-Thirty-three years?

22
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,293
The way he looks?
That's pretty much impossible.

23
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,915
MISSING

24
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,083
What day is it today?

25
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,668
-Pardon?
-What day is it today?

26
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,580
November 9th.

27
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,880
I know this sounds crazy...

28
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,961
but what year?

29
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,130
'86.

30
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,035
Thanks.

31
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,460
Wait.

32
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,666
Are you looking for someone?

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,830
Yes.

34
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,576
A friend.

35
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,791
Michael Kahnwald.

36
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,375
Never heard of him.

37
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,578
-Ines Kahnwald's son?
-The nurse?

38
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,003
She doesn't have any kids.

39
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,036
Do you know where I can find Ines?

40
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,878
At the hospital maybe.

41
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,630
Well, see you.

42
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,288
Regina, you stupid four-eyes!

43
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,711
We got the power plant shift schedule
for the night Mads disappeared.

44
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,128
I want you to interview them
so we can check their routes and times.

45
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,538
-Maybe we'll find something.
-Can't someone else do that?

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,710
I'm working on the case with his brother.

47
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,001
A rape charge.

48
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,253
I mean, we never did consider

49
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,833
whether he may be involved
in his brother's disappearance.

50
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,746
Yes.

51
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,380
Egon.

52
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,503
This isn't the 1950s.

53
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,785
We don't base investigations on hunches,
but on evidence.

54
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,125
You have three months until retirement.

55
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,458
Then you can do whatever you want.
Until then, you do what I want.

56
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,503
33 YEARS?

57
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,713
'86.

58
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,711
'86. '86.

59
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,081
I'm just saying
the ground shook yesterday.

60
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,248
I know this isn't an earthquake zone,
but the ground shook.

61
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,173
-The search warrant for the power plant.
-I have to go.

62
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,040
You have my number
in case you think of anything.

63
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,995
Should I tell Ulrich?

64
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,211
No. Why would anyone talk to me?

65
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,746
Egon.

66
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,378
Helge. You're the one I wanted to see.

67
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,205
Can I help you?

68
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,628
It's about the missing Nielsen boy.

69
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,538
The night he disappeared,
you were on your shift, right?

70
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,205
Yes.

71
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,751
Martin wants to document and corroborate
the routes and times

72
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,213
of everyone who was near here that night.

73
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,791
I have to do my rounds
and check the blocks now.

74
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,785
Okay.

75
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,671
Let's arrange a time
for you to come to the station.

76
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,828
-Day after tomorrow.
-Tuesday.

77
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,538
Is 10:30 okay?

78
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,076
That works.

79
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,166
Sorry for the trouble.

80
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,878
It's no trouble.

81
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,955
I just didn't see anything.
What I mean is...

82
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,291
Everything was totally normal.

83
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,463
Your shift ended at six?

84
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,378
Yes, that's when the night shift starts.

85
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,625
Did you take your car?

86
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,035
I took the state road.

87
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,998
Were you heading somewhere else?
Because you took the state road instead.

88
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,875
Isn't the forest road shorter?

89
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,128
Yeah.

90
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,828
I just picked something up for my father.

91
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,876
See you Tuesday.

92
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,210
Helge?

93
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,328
One more question.

94
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,205
Did you see his brother anywhere that day?

95
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,078
The older Nielsen boy, Ulrich.

96
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,291
Nope.

97
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,875
Till Tuesday.

98
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,673
POLICE DAY PLANNER 1986

99
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,625
INTERVIEW: JANA NIELSEN

100
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,503
INTERVIEW: HELGE DOPPLER
WHY NOT FOREST ROAD?

101
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,628
"10:30, interview with Helge Doppler.
Why not forest road?"

102
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,460
SEARCH WARRANT

103
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,578
Can I help you?

104
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,415
Shouldn't you be in school?

105
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,670
I'm sick.

106
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
Well, you look just fine to me.

107
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,461
I hurt my arm. I'm headed to the hospital.

108
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,825
Get in. I'll drive you there.

109
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,956
"Bosch, Teller, Voigt,
Fleischer, Brandt... Doppler, Helge.

110
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,541
27."

111
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,750
CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: FUCHS, DOREEN

112
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,923
CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: DOPPLER, HELGE

113
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,246
Yes?

114
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,793
Did you know
that in 1986 your father-in-law

115
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,955
was to be interviewed
in my brother's case?

116
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:37,881
No.

117
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,288
I went through all the files.

118
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,665
Helge was supposed to be questioned
on Tuesday, November 11, 1986.

119
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,383
Exactly 33 years ago,
from the day after tomorrow.

120
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,828
But there is no statement. He didn't show.

121
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,376
There's just a note.

122
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:56,538
-"Why not forest road?"
-So you think Helge abducted Mads in 1986?

123
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,995
And now Mikkel and the other boys
33 years later?

124
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,383
-Where is he now?
- In the nursing home. Ulrich!

125
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,078
He's 75 years old. He has dementia.

126
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,536
And the evening Mikkel disappeared,

127
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,205
Helge was with me.

128
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,751
But the evening before Yasin vanished,
WÃ¶ller found Helge in the forest.

129
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,463
And took him back to the nursing home.

130
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,501
Somehow this all has to do with Mads.

131
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,673
-You're barking up the wrong tree.
- Maybe.

132
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,170
But maybe not.

133
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,538
What's your name?

134
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,995
Jonas.

135
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,750
And why didn't you have
your parents drive you?

136
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,671
My mom is at work.

137
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,248
My dad's dead.

138
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,960
Where does your mother work?

139
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,420
At the power plant.

140
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,210
The power plant has changed Winden.

141
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,788
This place used to look different.

142
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,501
What's that there?

143
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,826
Earphones.

144
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,035
Those aren't earphones.

145
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,706
You just put them in your ears.

146
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,875
Now I've seen it all.

147
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,746
It's a shortcut.

148
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,583
Well, here we are.

149
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,125
Wait.

150
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,248
Among you teenagers,

151
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,503
is...

152
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,133
Is Satanism a thing right now?

153
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,463
No idea.

154
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,916
No, I don't know. I don't think so.

155
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Call your mom to pick you up.

156
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,665
It's best not to walk
through the forest alone right now.

157
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,631
Thanks.

158
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,576
I'm looking for Ines Kahnwald.

159
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,583
-She was just outside with the boy.
-What boy?

160
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,075
What do you want Ines for?

161
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,666
I'm visiting and I locked myself out.

162
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,043
Ines didn't mention a visitor.

163
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,421
Are you related?

164
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,785
Yes, you could say that.

165
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,001
Maybe she's still out back.

166
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,383
-Otherwise, I'll tell her when I see her.
-No, I don't want to be any trouble.

167
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,630
Mr. Doppler?

168
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,713
Mr. Doppler?

169
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,880
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.
I'm a police officer.

170
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,418
Don't be scared.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

171
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,828
In 1986, a boy from Winden vanished,
Mads Nielsen.

172
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,376
Do you remember?

173
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,878
You were summoned to the station for
questioning, but there's no transcript.

174
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,918
What does "why not forest road" mean?

175
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
-He is...
-What does "why not forest road" mean?

176
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,246
-It's him!
-What does it mean?

177
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,786
-What are you doing here?
-It was him!

178
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,375
-I'm a cop. I want to ask a few questions.
-I know you!

179
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,708
What? What did you say?

180
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,381
-You have to go!
-What? Why were you summoned?

181
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,378
-I can change it. I can change the past.
-I need help!

182
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,961
And the future.

183
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,461
What did you say?

184
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,381
-What did you say? Where is Mikkel?
-Let him go!

185
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,128
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

186
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,168
Let me go! Tell me where my son is!

187
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,210
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

188
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,078
Let me go!

189
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,536
-Let me go! Don't touch me!
-I can change it.

190
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,543
I can change the past.

191
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,495
And the future.

192
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
Tick-tock.

193
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,128
Tick-tock.

194
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,790
Tick-tock.

195
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,625
Tick-tock.

196
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,458
Look! I managed to find another one.

197
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,000
How little we understand of the world.

198
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,628
Is this real?

199
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,538
Or am I crazy, just like my father?

200
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,746
Do you even exist?
Or are you the hallucination of a lunatic?

201
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,543
You're not crazy, neither was your father.

202
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,415
Sometimes it's hard for us
to grasp things that go against

203
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,330
all we are conditioned to believe.

204
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,673
How did people feel the first time
they were told the Earth was round?

205
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,575
-Yes, it is. It's totally insane.
-And if it's not?

206
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,498
How can that be?
Is there a breach in time in the cave?

207
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,328
So Mikkel hangs out here
until he becomes my father?

208
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,576
Even if you don't want to believe it,
that is your father.

209
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,165
That means...

210
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,415
that Ulrich is my grandfather and...

211
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,173
Martha is your aunt.

212
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,826
That's bullshit.

213
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,036
I'm taking him back
and putting this right.

214
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,785
Don't you get it?

215
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,916
If you take Mikkel back, you'll be
meddling in the course of events.

216
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,713
Your father will never meet your mother,
they won't fall in love or get married.

217
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,961
And you won't be born!

218
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,495
If you take him back now,

219
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,923
you'll be erasing your own existence.

220
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,380
The role you play in all of this
is much bigger than you think.

221
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,293
But every decision for something
is a decision against something else.

222
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,633
A life for a life.

223
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,043
What will you decide?

224
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,205
What's the big idea?
First the power plant, now this.

225
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,285
-You know that I have to suspend you.
-Things are going on that make no sense.

226
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,746
Maybe I'm going crazy.

227
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,286
The dead boy.

228
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,576
The boy we found in the forest.

229
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,670
Helge has something to do with it all.

230
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,745
I know you want
to find Mikkel at all costs.

231
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,631
But the end doesn't justify all means.

232
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,828
I should have taken you off this
on day one.

233
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,666
Helge said he can change
the past and the future.

234
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,960
-What's that mean? Why did he say that?
-Helge has dementia.

235
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,131
He can't even tie his own shoes anymore.

236
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:41,378
He's surely not responsible
for the disappearance of three children.

237
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,170
-He doesn't have the strength.
-Maybe he's not alone.

238
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,333
Go home.

239
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,333
"Why not forest road?"

240
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,170
What does that mean?

241
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,210
Egon Tiedemann wanted to ask him that.

242
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,918
"Why not forest road?"

243
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,126
I don't know who said it,
but Ulrich didn't rape me.

244
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,040
-You don't have to lie for him.
-But I'm not lying.

245
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,455
I wanted it.

246
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,455
We both wanted it. He didn't force me.

247
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,331
And your face? What happened there?

248
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,415
I fell down.

249
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,496
It has nothing to do with it.

250
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,583
Someone saw you.

251
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:31,286
-Saw how he hurt you.
-That can't be.

252
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,378
Then that person's lying.

253
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,035
-Who said that anyway?
-I'm not allowed to say that.

254
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,575
The only important thing is

255
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,290
that you know
that Ulrich can't harm you right now.

256
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,673
And that he will be punished
for what he did to you.

257
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,670
Ulrich didn't do anything.

258
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,043
If anything, I pressured him into it.

259
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,543
I asked him to get condoms.

260
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,291
But he'd never hurt me.

261
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,628
He would never do that.

262
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,205
Never.

263
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,575
I've been suspended.

264
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,830
Where are the kids?

265
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,285
No idea.

266
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,076
I'm sorry, Katharina.

267
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:47,918
I'm here now.

268
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,826
You haven't been here for a long time now.

269
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,875
What do you mean?

270
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,826
As long as I've known you,
you've wanted out of Winden.

271
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,495
Were you ever really happy?

272
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,080
What are you talking about?

273
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,630
Of course I was happy.

274
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,958
Weren't you?

275
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
I know, Ulrich.

276
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,541
What do you know?

277
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,376
About Hannah and you.

278
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,285
Did she tell you?

279
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,133
Does that matter?

280
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:23,786
Katharina.

281
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,705
I think I've known it all along.

282
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,960
I just didn't want to see it.

283
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,496
I can explain.

284
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,001
Please don't, Ulrich.

285
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,580
Oh, yeah.

286
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,631
Your mother called a while ago.

287
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,923
Our son has disappeared
and all she talks about is Mads.

288
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:12,376
And I thought my family
was the one full of assholes.

289
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,038
Hello.

290
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,131
Hello.

291
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,960
If you take him back now,

292
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,671
you'll be erasing your own existence.

293
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,171
But every decision for something

294
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,915
is a decision against something else.

295
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,133
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

296
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,418
Would you want to know,
after all these years?

297
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,670
What?

298
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,745
If he's dead.

299
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:10,496
No.

300
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,673
I have always held on
to the hope that he's alive.

301
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,666
Your father wanted the grave.

302
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,713
He thought it would help me
find some closure.

303
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,540
But there's no body in it.

304
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,705
For 33 years
I've been imagining that he's alive.

305
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,455
Free.

306
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,830
And happy.

307
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,380
You can never give up hope.

308
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:01,665
There's as much light out there
as there is darkness.

309
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,543
Don't forget that.

310
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,253
Katharina said
you wanted to tell me something.

311
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,705
One week before Mads...

312
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:29,206
I didn't tell the police this back then.
I didn't even remember.

313
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,791
I saw something.

314
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,828
In front of the house, across the way,
a priest was arguing with a man.

315
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,326
I don't know what about.

316
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,876
But I found it odd that a priest
would be arguing like that.

317
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:46,173
And this morning, I saw the same man.

318
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,496
The priest?

319
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,583
No, not the priest. The other man.

320
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,423
It was the same man.

321
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,671
I...

322
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,040
I know that because he had something
on his ear, it was...

323
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,793
It was scarred or disfigured.

324
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,251
But he wasn't a single day older.

325
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,918
He looked exactly like he did
33 years ago.

326
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,001
I know that sounds crazy.

327
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,880
But it was the same man.

328
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,495
Am I interrupting?

329
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:55,541
You wanted to know if the cave system
goes under the forest road by your cabin.

330
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,921
Not all of it is mapped out.

331
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,830
But at least parts of it extend
under the south part of the forest road.

332
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,628
What's with the cabin?
Is there anything in particular there?

333
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,750
No. Nothing.

334
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:17,963
Thanks.

335
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,418
Sure thing.

336
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,080
Charlotte?

337
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,416
Did you know that your father was supposed
to be questioned by the police in 1986?

338
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,670
No, I...

339
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:07,751
-Why do you ask?
-The cabin on the forest road.

340
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,921
Why did Helge keep it

341
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,790
after all that happened to him there?

342
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,495
Did he even use it?

343
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,923
Did he rent it out?

344
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,668
Why are you asking?

345
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,540
When was the first time you were there?

346
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,500
Was it already in 1986?

347
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,883
I don't know why you want to know that.

348
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,458
Did your father live in the cabin in '86?

349
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:28,673
I don't know.

350
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,580
Maybe.

351
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,538
I came to Winden in 1987.
I didn't know about the cabin then.

352
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,205
- That was after Helge's accident.
-When was that?

353
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,325
- Where are you now?
-When was the accident?

354
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,955
November 12th, 1986.

355
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,711
So three days from today.

356
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,245
Come home.

357
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,455
The kids have barely seen you in days.

358
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,210
They're worried.

359
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,291
And so am I.

360
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,915
-I have to go.
- Charlotte...

361
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,705
Dad, the question isn't how,
the question is when.

362
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,130
Boy, you startled me.

363
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,043
Where were you?

364
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:53,746
What's wrong?

365
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,421
Do you believe in fate?

366
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,915
I... I don't know.

367
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,876
Maybe it's my fate that men leave me.

368
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,075
I think Dad loved you very much.

369
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,826
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

370
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:47,538
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

371
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,333
This is Charlotte Doppler. I'll call back.

372
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,461
Charlotte,

373
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,421
the question isn't
who abducted the children, but when.

374
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,880
I was right, Helge Doppler.
Not now, but in 1986.

375
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,748
Call me back immediately
when you get this.

376
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:19,748
NOVEMBER 5, 1953
NOVEMBER 9, 1953

377
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:11,916
